POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC:0 "Born in 1866, Alikhan Bukeikhanov was a part of the Kazakh upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Kazakh state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets and a diligent campaigner for Kazakh independence. After the Revolution of 1905, he split off to found the Alash Party - a moderate liberal political party advocating for an autonomous Kazakh entity in a greater Russia. This dream became real after the February Revolution of 1917, when thanks to Alexander Kerenskiy's support, Bukeikhanov was sent to Kazakhstan in order to organize a congress of Kazakhs in Semipalatinsk.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the Alash Autonomy became a battleground between several factions, although it eventually managed to assert the integrity of its territory. Having achieved the primary goal of his life, Bukeikhanov retired from his position as President and allowed democracy to take charge. Until 1925, that is. A war between the Alash Autonomy and Turkestan, and the Kolchak Coup in Russia turned the Autonomy's continued existence untenable. Bukeikhanov was placed back in charge by junior Kazakh officers and granted wide-reaching emergency powers to resolve the crisis - and ultimately, he did. Southern raids and Russian integrationist tendencies have forced him to continue the state of emergency. At this point, the 70 year old Bukeikhanov is simply... tired. Especially tired of the Russians. And as long as he is given a chance, he will not hesitate to break the Autonomy away from this rotten structure."

### Events ###
alash.1.t:0 "Independence for Alash Autonomy?"
alash.1.d:0 "Our country, despite nominally being part of Russia with an autonomous status, has been de facto independent since the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite a Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia while repelling an invasion from Turkestan, our status has remained unchanged thanks to Admiral Kolchak's coup attempt. Now, with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off the chains of its oppression and end our servitude to our oppressors!"
alash.1.a:0 "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
alash.1.b:0 "Declare full independence from Russia!"

alash.2.t:0 "Alash Autonomy declares independence!"
alash.2.d:0 "Terrible news! Our autonomous region of Alash Orda has decided to use the political chaos in Russia to sever almost all their ties with Russia and declare independence. While many hotheads in the General Staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this treachery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be for now..."
alash.2.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."

alash.9.t:0 "The Return of the Tsar"
alash.9.d:0 "A new tsar has been crowned in Russia! Our powerful Russian population is very pleased, and are considering whether they should direct our state into closer relations with the restored Empire."
alash.9.a:0 "We shall serve the new Tsar, but on our own terms."
alash.9.b:0 "All Russians and Kazakhs must be ruled by the Tsar."
alash.9.c:0 "He is the Tsar of Russia, not of Kazakhstan!"

alash.10.t:0 "The Alash Orda's resolve"
alash.10.d:0 "The Alash Orda has offered to serve us and accept the authority of the new tsar under the condition that we respect their autonomy. How should we respond?"
alash.10.a:0 "We welcome the return of our allies."
alash.10.b:0 "We must decline their offer politely."
alash.10.c:0 "Upstarts! Your lands are rightfully Russian!"

alash.11.t:0 "The submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.11.d:0 "The Russians who dominate the Alash Orda's political and economic affairs have asked for their territories to be incorporated into the Russian Empire. What should we do?"
alash.11.a:0 "Welcome their return."
alash.11.b:0 "We need friends, not serfs: you may serve as an independent nation."
alash.11.c:0 "We must decline - Central Asia is a wasteland we have no need of."

alash.12.t:0 "The Alash Orda's resolve"
alash.12.d:0 "Despite being dominated by ethnic Russians, the Alash Orda has proclaimed that they owe nothing to the Russian Empire and the tsar. How should we respond?"
alash.12.a:0 "They have a point - he's just the Tsar of Russia."
alash.12.b:0 "Send gifts to show the Tsar's generosity."
alash.12.c:0 "What the Tsar has given them, the Tsar shall take away!"

alash.19.t:0 "Help from Russia?"
alash.19.d:0 "We are faced with the threat of annihilation at the hands of Turkestan. Russia might be willing to help us, but we would have to make serious concessions. It may however be the only way to save ourselves from rule by fanatics in Turkestan..."
alash.19.a:0 "Beg the Russians for military aid."
alash.19.b:0 "Offer to submit to the Russians."
alash.19.c:0 "We shall fight on our own!"

alash.20.t:0 "Alash Orda requests aid"
alash.20.d:0 "Alash Orda is fighting for its life against Turkestan, and has sent a representative to us to beg for military assistance. This could be an excellent opportunity to cement our authority in Central Asia."
alash.20.a:0 "They may have war material and volunteers."
alash.20.b:0 "We shall fight on the side of the Kazakhs."
alash.20.c:0 "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.20.e:0 "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."

alash.21.t:0 "Aid from Russia!"
alash.21.d:0 "The Russians have sent troops and volunteers to help us in the fight against Turkestan!"
alash.21.a:0 "Great!"

alash.22.t:0 "The Submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.22.d:0 "The Kazakhs are in danger of being eliminated by the forces of Turkestan. They have come to the conclusion that only by being incorporated into Russia will they be able to live in peace and freedom. If we accept them, we will be fighting Turkestan ourselves..."
alash.22.a:0 "We welcome the Kazakhs and pledge to defend their rights."
alash.22.b:0 "We cannot risk such entanglements."

alash.23.t:0 "War in Central Asia!"
alash.23.d:0 "The recent outbreak of hostilities in Central Asia is worrying and has destabilized our frontiers. The Kazakhs have recently proclaimed that they shall fight on their own against Turkestan, but it seems that they are too weak to survive for very long. This is an opportunity we could use to extend our influence into traditionally Russian lands..."
alash.23.a:0 "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.23.b:0 "Should Turkestan come near our borders, we shall fight them."
alash.23.c:0 "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."
alash.23.e:0 "Only Russian armies can bring order to Central Asia!"
