 HOL_drop_golden_standard_desc: "Wir halten uns an den Goldstandard, damit Investoren den Gulden als eine stabile Währung ansehen, die jederzeit bei der Zentralbank gegen Gold eingetauscht werden kann. Ein unglücklicher Nebeneffekt eines starken Guldens ist, dass es für Menschen aus anderen Ländern teuer wird, niederländische Produkte zu kaufen. Indem wir den Goldstandard aufgeben und den Gulden abwerten, können wir diese Auswirkungen abmildern."
 HOL_defense_spending_spree: "Spendierwut im Verteidigungsbereich"
 HOL_defense_spending_spree_desc: "Wir werden unser Militär wieder auf das Niveau der übrigen Welt bringen. Sozialisten und andere unpatriotische Leute sagen, dass das Militär der letzte Ort sein sollte, an dem die Regierung in diesen Zeiten investieren sollte, aber wir werden ihnen das Gegenteil beweisen!"
 HOL_extend_unemployment_sub: "Arbeitslosenzuschüsse erhöhen"
 HOL_extend_unemployment_sub_desc: "Infolge des Schwarzen Montags sind mehr Menschen arbeitslos als je zuvor. Die konservativen und vor allem die liberalen Regierungen der letzten Jahrzehnte haben zwar eine Grundsubventionierung der Arbeitslosigkeit eingeführt, aber sie hatten Angst, die Arbeit zu erschweren, wenn sie die Sätze zu hoch ansetzten; in Verbindung mit der Inflation ist es unmöglich, von diesen Subventionen zu leben."
 HOL_rijksweg_12: "Reichsweg 12 fertigstellen"
 HOL_rijksweg_12_desc: "Bereits in der deutschen Glanzzeit unter Tirpitz gab es Pläne für den Bau einer Autobahn, die Den Haag mit der deutschen Grenze verbinden sollte, die jedoch nur bis Oudenrijn reichte. Die Verlängerung des Reichswegs bis zur deutschen Grenze wäre ein starkes Symbol für das Engagement unserer Regierung für andere nationale Infrastrukturprojekte."
 HOL_trade_missions: "Handelsmissionen"
 HOL_trade_missions_desc: "Handelsmissionen, die darauf abzielen, eine Einigung mit ausländischen Regierungen und Unternehmen zu erzielen, sind eine gute Möglichkeit, die Reichweite der niederländischen Wirtschaft zu vergrößern und den derzeitigen wirtschaftlichen Abschwung möglicherweise zu mildern."
 HOL_loan_to_shell: "Darlehen an Shell"
 HOL_loan_to_shell_desc: "Die Royal Dutch Shell hat in den 1920er Jahren eine Reihe harter Jahre hinter sich. Während andere niederländische Unternehmen florierten, erlitt Shell in der Revolution von 1925 den katastrophalen Verlust ihrer britischen Beteiligungen, eine Situation, die erst durch unseren Beitritt zum deutschen Wirtschaftsraum des Reichspakts gemildert wurde. Wir können ihnen ein Darlehen gewähren, das sich sicherlich in eine für beide Seiten vorteilhafte Investition verwandeln wird."
 HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies: "Kürzung der Beschäftigungsleistungen"
 HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies_desc: "Immer mehr Menschen werden von ihrem Arbeitsplatz entlassen, und die Staatskasse wird durch ihre Nachfrage nach Subventionen und Leistungen immer stärker belastet. Wenn wir am Ende nicht mit einer monströsen Verschuldung dastehen wollen, müssen wir die verfügbaren Mittel kürzen."
 HOL_country_of_canals: "Ein Land der Kanäle"
 HOL_country_of_canals_desc: "Durch den Bau von Kanälen in den gesamten Niederlanden werden wir unsere arbeitslose Bevölkerung in Arbeit halten, während verjüngte Unternehmen von den Kanälen und der damit verbundenen Infrastruktur in der Zukunft profitieren werden."
 HOL_factory_building: "Fabrikgebäude"
 HOL_factory_building_desc: "Durch den Bau weiterer Fabriken wird das Land in der Lage sein, seine heimische Militärproduktion zu steigern. Auch wenn wir ein Transitland sind, kann es nie schaden, auch in andere Bereiche zu investieren."
 HOL_rhine_line: "Die Rheinlinie"
 HOL_rhine_line_desc: "Seit den Anfängen des kommunistischen Regimes in Frankreich planen die gottlosen Syndikalisten unsere Vernichtung und die unseres deutschen Nachbarn. Der Rhein ist ein bedeutendes Hindernis für dieses Ziel, und wenn wir ihn mit Festungen verstärken, wird, wenn Gott uns segnet, kein ausländischer Syndikalist seinen Fuß auf niederländischen Boden nördlich des Rheins setzen."
 HOL_limited_working_week_2: "Begrenzte Wochenarbeitszeit"
 HOL_limited_working_week_2_desc: "Die Mindestwochenarbeitszeit ist zu lang, so dass die Arbeitgeber es sich nicht leisten können, so viele Menschen einzustellen, wie sie es sonst könnten. Durch die Verkürzung der Wochenarbeitszeit werden die Arbeitgeber gezwungen sein, mehr Menschen einzustellen, so dass mehr Menschen ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen können."
 hol_finish_afsluitdijk: "Verbessern der Deichschleusen"
 hol_finish_afsluitdijk_desc: "Die Deichschleusen wurde in den frühen dreißiger Jahren fertiggestellt und schließt die Zuiderzee ab, wodurch das IJsselmeer zu einer Binnenbucht wird. Die Gefahr, dass der Deich bricht, könnte jedoch katastrophale Auswirkungen haben, so dass Investitionen in die Sicherung seiner strukturellen Integrität nicht schaden können. Außerdem würde dies auch dringend benötigte Arbeit für Arbeitslose schaffen."
 HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost: "Westindisches Handelszentrum"
 HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost_desc: "Die Westindischen Inseln sind ideal gelegen, um als Handelsposten für den Handel mit der westlichen Hemisphäre zu dienen. Die Amerikaner, weit entfernt von Deutschlands Einflussbereich, können auch eine Chance zur Diversifizierung unserer Exporte bieten, die derzeit zu sehr auf das Kaiserreich konzentriert sind."
 HOL_loan_to_SBM: "Darlehen an SBM"
 HOL_loan_to_SBM_desc: "Die Surinaamse Bauxiet Maatschappij ist ein Bergbauunternehmen in Niederländisch-Guayana. Durch die Gewährung eines Darlehens können sie ihre Aktivitäten auf dem südamerikanischen Kontinent ausweiten und uns hoffentlich mehr militärisch wichtige Ressourcen als je zuvor liefern."
 HOL_kill_workplace_regulations: "Bürokratieabbau bei Arbeitgebern"
 HOL_kill_workplace_regulations_desc: "Einer der Faktoren, der die niederländische Industrie hinter die ausländische Konkurrenz zurückfallen lässt, ist die Vielzahl hochentwickelter, aber schwerfälliger Sicherheitsvorschriften. Es ist traurig, aber in diesen Krisenzeiten können wir uns so etwas nicht leisten."
 HOL_park_in_every_town: "Ein Park für jede Stadt"
 HOL_park_in_every_town_desc: "Eine weitere Möglichkeit, unsere Arbeitslosen zu beschäftigen, ist der Bau vieler Parks. Noch nicht geborene Generationen werden in diesen ruhigen Anlagen, die in diesen schweren Zeiten gebaut wurden, zur Besinnung kommen können."
 HOL_draft_able_unemployed: "Zwangsarbeit Wehrdienst"
 HOL_draft_able_unemployed_desc: "Viele so genannte Arbeitslose behaupten, sie fänden keine Arbeit, und gleichzeitig finden wir keine Leute, die das Vaterland verteidigen. Diese paradoxe Situation wird jetzt ein Ende haben. Wenn man Geld vom Staat bekommen will, dann muss man auch etwas dafür tun, auch wenn das bedeutet, dass unsere Soldaten etwas weniger motiviert sein werden."
 HOL_finish_fortress_holland: "Medienzensur"
 HOL_finish_fortress_holland_desc: "Wir können nicht einfach auf den Intellekt des einfachen Mannes vertrauen und müssen die dreckigen Syndikalisten blockieren, wo wir können. Durch die Zensur der meisten französischen Medien und eine begrenzte Zensur bekannter, mit den Syndikalisten verbundener Medien werden wir diese trüben Gewässer eindämmen."
 HOL_privatization_of_projects: "Privatisierung von Projekten"
 HOL_privatization_of_projects_desc: "Unsere Investitionen haben Früchte getragen: Unternehmen bekunden ihr Interesse daran, einige unserer nationalen Projekte zu übernehmen, in der Hoffnung, daraus Profit zu schlagen. Dazu müssen sie Menschen einstellen, die wiederum mehr Geld ausgeben. Auch wenn wir uns noch nicht vollständig vom Schwarzen Montag erholt haben, wird dies sicherlich der Anfang vom Ende des Leidens unserer Nation sein."
 HOL_precrisis_export_rates: "Rückkehr zu Vorkrisen-Exportraten"
 HOL_precrisis_export_rates_desc: "Unsere Bemühungen, die niederländischen Unternehmen so lukrativ wie möglich zu machen, haben Früchte getragen: Die Exportraten erreichen wieder das Vorkrisenniveau und übertreffen es in einigen Sektoren sogar. Um die Arbeitsbelastung zu bewältigen, sind die Unternehmen gezwungen, mehr Mitarbeiter einzustellen, was zu mehr Kaufkraft bei den Bürgern führt. Auch wenn dies noch nicht auf eine vollständige Erholung hinausläuft, ist es möglich, einen hellen Horizont vor uns zu sehen."
 HOL_less_unemployment: "Arbeitslosigkeit gesenkt"
 HOL_less_unemployment_desc: "Unser Arbeitsentlastungsprogramm hat Früchte getragen: Tag für Tag kommen weniger Menschen zum Stempeln, um zu beweisen, dass sie tatsächlich arbeitslos sind und ihre Subventionen nicht als kostenloses Zusatzgeld zu ihrem regulären Gehalt beanspruchen. Es scheint, dass wir erfolgreich waren, und obwohl wir uns noch nicht vollständig vom Schwarzen Montag erholt haben, scheinen die schlimmsten Auswirkungen der Krise abgeklungen zu sein."
 HOL_more_spending_power: "Mehr Kaufkraft"
 HOL_more_spending_power_desc: "Unsere umfangreichen Investitionen in das Militär führen dazu, dass die Menschen in einer Reihe von Sektoren Arbeit finden, von der Waffenproduktion bis zum Dienst in der Armee selbst. Infolgedessen haben sie Geld zum Ausgeben, was nun langsam den Aufschwung auch in anderen Sektoren in Gang setzt. Wir haben uns zwar noch nicht vollständig vom Schwarzen Montag erholt, aber wir sind sicher, dass dies der Anfang vom Ende des Leidens ist."
 HOL_recovery_from_black_monday: "Erholung vom Schwarzen Montag"
 HOL_recovery_from_black_monday_desc: "Unsere solide Strategie zur Bekämpfung des Wirtschaftseinbruchs nach dem Schwarzen Montag hat zu einer Stabilisierung unserer Wirtschaft geführt. In allen Sektoren sind mehr Menschen beschäftigt, es werden mehr Produkte verkauft und immer mehr Liquidität ist im Umlauf. Es scheint uns gelungen zu sein, das Land durch eine schwierige Zeit zu führen, und die Menschen blicken wieder zuversichtlich in die Zukunft."
 HOL_repay_government_debts: "Staatsschulden zurückzahlen"
 HOL_repay_government_debts_desc: "Es ist leider eine Tatsache, dass Geld nicht auf Bäumen wächst, und die Regierung war gezwungen, eine Reihe von Anleihen zu begeben und ausländische Investoren um Kredite zu bitten, um die Lücke zu füllen. Es ist dringend erforderlich, dass wir diese Schulden eher früher als später begleichen."
 HOL_control_inflation: "Inflation kontrollieren"
 HOL_control_inflation_desc: "Da die Inflation aufgrund des Schwarzen Montags immer noch unangenehm hoch ist, müssen wir deflationäre Maßnahmen ergreifen, um sie unter Kontrolle zu bringen. Zum Beispiel, indem wir fordern, dass die Reservesätze der Banken erhöht werden, damit sie gezwungen sind, mehr Kapital zu halten. Solche Maßnahmen werden dazu beitragen, eine Überhitzung unserer gerade erst geretteten Wirtschaft zu verhindern."
 HOL_restore_regulation: "Wiederherstellung der Vorkrisenregelungen"
 HOL_restore_regulation_desc: "Die etwas brutale Politik der Jahre des Schwarzen Montags hat ihren Zweck gut erfüllt, indem sie Anreize für die Wirtschaft geschaffen und die Staatsausgaben erhöht hat. Dennoch ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass wir das verlorene Vertrauen unseres Volkes wiederherstellen, indem wir ihm einige seiner lange verdienten Privilegien zurückgeben."
 HOL_eastern_industrialization: "Industrialisierung des Ostens"
 HOL_eastern_industrialization_desc: "Importe aus Deutschland und dem Grenzgebiet sind die Zukunft. Wenn wir in diese Region investieren, können wir vom grenzüberschreitenden Handel profitieren und eine Reihe neuer Unternehmen ansiedeln."
 HOL_northern_industrialization: "Industrialisierung des Nordens"
 HOL_northern_industrialization_desc: "Wir haben bereits Fonds eingerichtet, um Unternehmen im Norden des Landes zu unterstützen. Jetzt müssen wir sie nur noch für Anträge öffnen."
 HOL_dutch_arms_industry: "Konsolidierung der Rüstungsindustrie"
 HOL_dutch_arms_industry_desc: "Unsere jüngsten Bemühungen um Anreize für kleine Unternehmen zahlen sich bereits aus, vor allem im inländischen Bereich. Dennoch ist es jetzt von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass wir eine Reihe von kleinen Militärfirmen ermutigen, sich zusammenzuschließen, damit sie einen bedeutenden Beitrag zu unserem Militärsektor leisten können."
 HOL_subs_philips: "Philips subventionieren"
 HOL_subs_philips_desc: "Philips ist einer unserer bekanntesten Konzerne und ein Global Player auf dem Elektronikmarkt. Indem wir ihre Forschung und Entwicklung subventionieren und Joint Ventures mit ihnen eingehen, können wir sie für unsere eigenen staatlichen Zwecke nutzbar machen."
 HOL_subs_spyker: "Investitionen in Spyker"
 HOL_subs_spyker_desc: "Auch wenn Spyker Höhen und Tiefen erlebt hat, ist das Unternehmen aufgrund seines militärischen Wertes ein wichtiger Akteur in unserem Land. Durch die Investition in eine Mehrheitsbeteiligung an dem Unternehmen könnten wir seine Fähigkeiten im Automobilbereich für die Entwicklung mechanischer Technologien nutzen."
 HOL_subs_werkspoor: "Werkspoor Darlehen"
 HOL_subs_werkspoor_desc: "Das Unternehmen Werkspoor ist unser wichtigster Rüstungsentwickler, und als solcher sollten wir seine Bedeutung als potenzieller Motor für die Verbesserung des Potenzials unserer Armee in naher Zukunft nicht übersehen."
 HOL_booming_economy: "Wirtschaftsboom"
 HOL_booming_economy_desc: "Mit dem richtigen Maß an Einmischung und einem unbürokratischen Ansatz ist unsere Wirtschaft weniger ein Schatten ihres früheren Selbst als vielmehr ein regelrechter Phönix geworden. Holland ist stark, und unser Land boomt."
 HOL_SDAP_question: "Die SDAP-Frage"
 HOL_SDAP_question_desc: "Jetzt, da die Niederlande in eine neue gesellschaftspolitische Ordnung eintreten, ist es an der Zeit zu überlegen, ob die eher zentristische SDAP zu den Wahlen zu der Versammlung zugelassen werden soll, die über die Zukunft des Landes entscheidet. Sie könnte ein Trojanisches Pferd für Reaktionäre sein."
 HOL_elect_assembly: "Neue Versammlung wählen"
 HOL_elect_assembly_desc: "Wir müssen entscheiden, wen wir in unser neues gesetzgebendes Organ wählen, um einen neuen verfassungsrechtlichen Rahmen für Holland zu schaffen."
 HOL_third_national_assembly: "Die Dritte Nationalversammlung"
 HOL_third_national_assembly_desc: "Die Zeit ist reif. Die Versammlung wird über die Besetzung der einzelnen Posten im neuen exekutiven Volksrat entscheiden, so dass alle linken Parteien ein Mitspracherecht in dieser neuen politischen Ordnung haben."
 HOL_Industrial_Democracy: "Industrielle Demokratie"
 HOL_Industrial_Democracy_desc: "Nicht mehr einige wenige sollen Entscheidungen für viele treffen. Unsere Arbeitnehmer sollen stärker in die Entscheidungsfindung einbezogen werden und Verantwortung und Autorität am Arbeitsplatz teilen."
 HOL_Rebuilding_the_country: "Wiederaufbau [HOL.GetNameDef]"
 HOL_Rebuilding_the_country_desc: "Nachdem die [HOL.GetRulingPartylong] in der Dritten Nationalversammlung zur Regierung gewählt wurde, versucht sie, die [HOL.GetNameDef] von Grund auf neu aufzubauen."
 HOL_one_raadspensionaris: "Ein Ratspensionär!"
 HOL_one_raadspensionaris_desc: "Unerwarteterweise scheint der größte Teil der Versammlung zu einem einfachen Schluss gekommen zu sein. Es soll nur einen einzigen 'Hochpensionär' geben, David Wijnkoop, der die Revolution gegen Reaktionäre und Imperialisten ohne ein Fünkchen Gnade bewachen soll."
 HOL_council_of_the_state: "Der Staatsrat"
 HOL_council_of_the_state_desc: "Die Ratskommunisten unter Anton Pannekoek und seiner KAPN haben in der neuen Versammlung die Mehrheit errungen und sind damit die führende Kraft im Exekutivorgan des Volksraads. Für die Kommunisten, die für ihre Ablehnung formeller Entscheidungsgremien bekannt sind, war dies ein ziemlicher Schock."
 HOL_vakbondsfederatie: "Vakbondsfederatie (Gewerkschaftsföderation)"
 HOL_vakbondsfederatie_desc: "Die Versammlung entschied sich mehrheitlich für die syndikalistische NAS-Partei von Jacques de Kadt, die eine kommunistische Herrschaft unter einer 'Föderation der Gewerkschaften' anstrebt. Die NAS ist die 'orthodoxeste' der ernstzunehmenden linken Gruppen im Land und stellt einen klaren Kompromiss zwischen allen Beteiligten dar."
 HOL_socialist_republic: "Sozialistische Republik"
 HOL_socialist_republic_desc: "Die Radikale Sozialistische Partei RSAP von Henk Sneevliet wurde von der Versammlung mit einer Mehrheit zur neuen Regierung gewählt. Es ist wahrscheinlich, dass eine neue Sozialistische Republik gebildet wird, in der es weniger offenes Auftreten der hart linken Syndikalisten und reaktionäre Rückschritte der SDAP gibt."
 HOL_social_democracy: "Sozialdemokratie"
 HOL_social_democracy_desc: "Zum Entsetzen vieler Anwesenden stellte sich heraus, dass der gewählte Volksraad tatsächlich der der gemäßigten SDAP unter Willem Albard war. Für die anderen, militanteren Fraktionen der Revolution war es offenbar ein schwerer Fehler, die SDAP an den Wahlen teilnehmen zu lassen."
 HOL_peoples_military: "Die Volksarmee"
 HOL_peoples_military_desc: "Die Revolution hat nicht stattgefunden, nur um von Eigeninteressen und Imperialisten in unseren eigenen Streitkräften zum Scheitern gebracht zu werden. Es müssen ernsthafte Reformen durchgeführt werden, um sie von gefährlichen Übeltätern zu säubern und die Kommune zu erhalten."
 HOL_union_of_the_military: "Einheit des Militärs"
 HOL_union_of_the_military_desc: "Auch wenn es vielleicht nicht ideal ist, dass ein Großteil unserer Streitkräfte reuelose Kapitalisten und Reaktionäre sind, müssen wir mit dem arbeiten, was wir haben. Die Niederländer, sowohl die Linken als auch die Rechten, müssen für das Wohl unseres Landes zusammenarbeiten."
 HOL_dutch_militia: "Niederländische Milizen"
 HOL_dutch_militia_desc: "Der Weg nach vorn für unsere Streitkräfte ist die Rekrutierung von Volksmilizen, die uns helfen, die Revolution zu schützen und zu verhindern, dass ausländische Kräfte uns vernichten, bevor wir es geschafft haben, auf die Beine zu kommen."
 HOL_reform_army: "Armeereform"
 HOL_reform_army_desc: "Nachdem die neue Ordnung sowohl in der Versammlung als auch im Volksraad gesichert ist, müssen wir unseren Blick auf die Streitkräfte richten. Die jüngsten politischen Turbulenzen haben dazu geführt, dass sie schlecht ausgebildet und personell unterbesetzt sind. Das müssen wir sofort ändern."
 HOL_ban_reactionary_thought: "Exercitiegenootschap (Bürgermiliz)"
 HOL_ban_reactionary_thought_desc: "Die Revolution ist noch lange nicht gesichert. Auf Schritt und Tritt gibt es eine weitere Bedrohung, die systematisch beseitigt werden muss, um das zu bewahren, was wir bisher erreicht haben. Ausgehend von unserer Geschichte werden wir diejenigen, die unseren Idealen treu sind, mit einer Armee ausstatten, um alle, die unsere Revolution bedrohen, auszuschalten."
 HOL_Revolutionary_Vanguard: "Revolutionäre Vorhut"
 HOL_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc: "Die Revolution kann nicht warten; sie muss vorangetrieben werden, damit sich die Arbeiter der Welt unter einem Banner vereinigen können. Brecht die Ketten!!!"
 HOL_Enshrine_Leninism: "Leninismus verankern"
 HOL_Enshrine_Leninism_desc: "Der inzwischen verstorbene russische marxistische Revolutionär Wladimir Lenin erklärte, dass sich das Proletariat gegen seine kapitalistischen Sklavenhalter erheben und die Vorhut der Revolution sein wird. Wir werden in die Fußstapfen dieses großen Mannes treten."
 HOL_war_communism: "Kriegssyndikalismus"
 HOL_labour_camps: "Arbeitslager"
 HOL_labour_camps_desc: "Unsere politischen und ideologischen Feinde können den Frieden durch Arbeit erlernen, indem sie als Soldaten für die Revolution in den Minen und in den Lagern arbeiten. Dort können sie, entwaffnet, kaum eine Bedrohung für uns darstellen und über ihre fehlerhaften Überzeugungen und Handlungen nachdenken."
 HOL_democratic_workplace: "Demokratische Arbeitsplätze"
 HOL_democratic_workplace_desc: "Alle Arbeitnehmer müssen ein Mitspracherecht in dem Unternehmen haben, für das sie schuften. Arbeitgeber und Reaktionäre dürfen nicht länger diejenigen unterdrücken, die für sie schuften - zumindest nicht ohne Vertretung."
 HOL_Mixed_Eco: "Sozialistische Wirtschaftsplanung"
 HOL_Mixed_Eco_desc: "Die Möglichkeit, die Wirtschaft im Sinne der Arbeitnehmer zu planen, wird es der Regierung ermöglichen, die Entwicklung in erster Linie im Sinne der Arbeitnehmer und nicht im Sinne des Profits zu lenken."
 HOL_Communal_Eco: "Gemischte Wirtschaft"
 HOL_Communal_Eco_desc: "Unter der [HOL.GetRulingParty] arbeiten private und staatliche Unternehmen zusammen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Arbeiter und die Reaktionäre an erster Stelle stehen."
 HOL_Proletarian_Humanism: "Proletarischer Humanismus"
 HOL_Proletarian_Humanism_desc: "Die [HOL.trulingparty] unterstützt die Einführung des Syndikalismus in [HOL.getname] im Tempo eines Faultiers. Sie ist der Ansicht, dass der Mensch von der natürlichen Ordnung der Dinge abweicht und als solcher auch so behandelt werden sollte."
 HOL_Industrial_Syn: "Industriesyndikalismus"
 HOL_Industrial_Syn_desc: "Die Niederlande haben sich dank der Ausbeutung der Arbeiter und ihrer kolonialen Sklaven zu einem Zentrum der Industrialisierung entwickelt. Jetzt, wo das Proletariat an der Macht ist, sind wir in der Lage, das Unrecht des Kapitalismus zu korrigieren und sicherzustellen, dass die Rechte des Arbeiters an erster Stelle stehen."
 HOL_Factory_Towns: "Fabrikstädte"
 HOL_Factory_Towns_desc: "Um den Schutz der Arbeitnehmer vor den Gegenreaktionären zu gewährleisten, müssen wir dafür sorgen, dass sie in ihren Städten sicher sind. Selbst wenn das bedeutet, dass sie nicht weggehen können, insbesondere diejenigen mit deutschem Hintergrund..."
 HOL_mass_collectivisation: "Massenkollektivierung"
 HOL_mass_collectivisation_desc: "Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil unserer Wirtschaftsdoktrin ist die Kollektivierung von Landwirtschaft und Industrie, wobei kleinere Einheiten einem größeren und effizienteren Zentrum unterstellt werden."
 HOL_Improve_Unions: "Prüfung der Gewerkschaftsgesetze"
 HOL_Improve_Unions_desc: "Wir müssen uns ein Beispiel an [FRA.getname] nehmen, die zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt der Gnade ihrer eigenen Gewerkschaften ausgeliefert war, die die Wirtschaft mit unehrlichen und fast kapitalistischen Mitteln gelenkt haben. Wir werden unsere Maßnahmen verschärfen, um sicherzustellen, dass dies in unserer kleinen Nation nicht geschieht."
 HOL_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy: "Wiederaufbau der Bürokratie"
 HOL_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "Es wird Jahre dauern, bis der Makel der Vorgängerregierung vollständig beseitigt ist. Auch wenn wir Schritte unternehmen, um uns von ihrer kapitalistischen Bürokratie zu befreien und sie durch eine zu ersetzen, die sich um die Arbeitnehmer kümmert."
 HOL_verzorgingsstaat: "Wohlfahrtsstaat"
 HOL_verzorgingsstaat_desc: "Das Mindeste, was wir unseren Bürgern schulden, ist ein gut verwalteter und gut funktionierender Wohlfahrtsstaat, der sowohl für Sozialisten als auch für Konservative akzeptabel ist."
 HOL_union_liberty_constitution: "Freiheitliche Verfassung der Union"
 HOL_union_liberty_constitution_desc: "Die Formalisierung der neuen politischen Ordnung unserer Nation durch eine formelle Verfassung würde die Bedenken vieler konservativerer Niederländer zerstreuen und unsere Exekutive in ihrer neuen Rolle legitimieren."
 HOL_market_socialism: "Marktsyndikalismus"
 HOL_market_socialism_desc: "Nur weil es in Holland eine neue linke Ordnung gibt, heißt das nicht, dass wir alle alten Zöpfe abschneiden sollten. Schließlich bieten die Märkte in vielen Bereichen Anreize für die Arbeitnehmer, auch im Baugewerbe."
 HOL_block_german_trade: "Handelsembargo gegen Deutschland"
 HOL_block_german_trade_desc: "Zu lange hat die Bastion des Imperialismus in unserem Osten eine existenzielle Bedrohung für alles Gute und Gerechte in dieser Welt dargestellt. Die Bemühungen Deutschlands, die Arbeiterklasse überall dort zu ersticken, wo es sie gibt, bedeuten, dass eine Fortsetzung des Handels mit Deutschland absurd wäre."
 HOL_tolerate_german_trade: "Deutschen Handel tolerieren"
 HOL_tolerate_german_trade_desc: "Für viele bedeutete der Gedanke, die neue Realität der sozialistischen Herrschaft zu akzeptieren, eine Kollision unserer Nation mit dem Ungetüm Kaiserreich. Die Regierung hat jedoch beschlossen, dass die Fortsetzung der Beziehungen zu Deutschland für unser Land nur von Nutzen sein kann."
 HOL_join_international: "Beitritt zur Internationale"
 HOL_join_international_desc: "Wenn wir unseren Teil zum Kampf gegen Reaktionäre, Monarchismus und die Tyrannei des Imperialismus beitragen wollen, müssen wir uns der gesamten Internationalen in ihrem Kampf gegen die Feinde anschließen, egal wo sie sich befinden."
 HOL_european_centroamerica: "Batavische Neutralität"
 HOL_european_centroamerica_desc: "Es gibt einige in unserer Regierung, die einen Konflikt gegen Kapitalisten und Imperialisten befürworten, aber viele andere schlagen jetzt insgeheim eine neue Politik vor - mit dem Slogan 'Batavische Neutralität'. Dabei geht es lediglich um die Fortsetzung unserer bisherigen Neutralität mit einem neuen sozialistischen Anstrich."
 HOL_finish_national_assembly: "Beendigung der Nationalversammlung"
 HOL_finish_national_assembly_desc: "Mit einer Reihe von grundlegenden Reformen und Vorschlägen scheint sich die Versammlung nun ihrem Ende zu nähern und ihren Hauptzweck erfüllt zu haben. Sie war von unschätzbarem Wert für die Gestaltung unseres neuen sozio-politischen Systems und ihr Vermächtnis wird weiterleben."
 HOL_reijnders_putsch: "Reijnders' Putsch"
 HOL_reijnders_putsch_desc: "In einer absolut schockierenden Wendung der Ereignisse hat der Chef der niederländischen Armee, Izaak Reijnders, in Amsterdam einen Militärputsch gestartet und erklärt, dass die Nation in Gefahr sei, an gefährliche syndikalistische Subversive zu geraten. Das Schicksal der Niederlande ist vorerst ungewiss."
 HOL_VNH_victory: "VNH Wahlsieg"
 HOL_VNH_victory_desc: "Die VNH haben bei den jüngsten Wahlen einen erstaunlichen Sieg errungen und die konservative CNA abgelöst, was die Nation in Ungewissheit stürzt. Was die neue Regierung tun wird, ist noch ungewiss."
 HOL_CNA_gamble_worked: "CNAs Wagnis zahlt sich aus"
 HOL_CNA_gamble_worked_desc: "Der regierenden CNA ist es gelungen, einen weiteren Wahlsieg zu erringen, so dass sie weiterhin unangefochten das Land regiert. Dennoch ist ihre Mehrheit geschrumpft, und sie muss möglicherweise einen Koalitionspartner finden, um weiterhin die Autorität und das Mandat zu haben, das sie einst hatte. Dennoch bleibt der Status quo bestehen - vorerst."
 HOL_junta_consolidation: "Konsolidierung der Junta"
 HOL_junta_consolidation_desc: "Da der Putsch ein voller Erfolg war, obliegt es nun den Machthabern, ihre Herrschaft zu formalisieren. Durch die Konsolidierung der Mitglieder der neuen provisorischen Militärjunta an der Spitze der Niederlande wird einer müden Nation die dringend benötigte Stabilität verliehen."
 HOL_intimidate_parliament: "Einschüchterung des Parlaments"
 HOL_intimidate_parliament_desc: "Der neue Status quo kann nicht garantiert werden, ohne dass das Parlament gezwungen wird, Notstandsbefugnisse zu erteilen. Solche Maßnahmen mögen unangenehm sein, aber sie sind notwendig, um eine syndikalistische Revolte abzuwehren."
 HOL_alliance_of_the_right: "Allianz der Rechten"
 HOL_alliance_of_the_right_desc: "Die Probleme Hollands können nicht von einer Partei allein gelöst werden. Nationalisten und Konservative müssen sich in ihren Zielen einig sein, wenn diese Nation vor den Gefahren des radikalen Denkens gerettet werden soll."
 HOL_CNA_on_its_own: "CNA Regiert Alleine"
 HOL_CNA_on_its_own_desc: "Wir brauchen keine anderen. Holland hat nur eine lenkende Hand, und sie wird die Gesellschaft bis zu ihrem letzten Atemzug bewahren, so Gott will."
 HOL_work_with_LSP: "Zusammenarbeit mit dem LSP"
 HOL_work_with_LSP_desc: "Wenn wir mit anderen zusammenarbeiten müssen, dann können wir nicht schlechter sein als die marktliberale LSP. Während unsere Überzeugungen in erster Linie sozialer Natur sind, stehen bei ihnen wirtschaftliche Belange im Vordergrund. Es ist ein Kompromiss, der nicht allzu viele Probleme aufwirft, zumindest im Vergleich zu unseren anderen 'Möglichkeiten'."
 HOL_martial_law_in_europe: "Kriegsrecht ausrufen"
 HOL_martial_law_in_europe_desc: "Wenn wir das neue Regime schützen wollen, dann ist es unerlässlich, dass wir sofort mit dem harten Durchgreifen beginnen und unsere Entschlossenheit demonstrieren, die politische Krise des Landes zu lösen. Indem wir das Kriegsrecht in Europa ausrufen, können wir unsere Entschlossenheit deutlich machen, Holland vor sich selbst zu retten."
 HOL_rebuild_binnenhof: "Wiederaufbau des Binnenhofs"
 HOL_rebuild_binnenhof_desc: "Der Binnenhof ist eine fast heilige Institution in den Niederlanden, und die Brandstiftung, die ihn zerstört hat, ist für viele ein deutliches Symbol für den Verfall unseres Staates und sein Abgleiten in den politischen Wahnsinn. Mit dem Wiederaufbau könnten wir ein weithin sichtbares Zeichen setzen, was wir für die Zukunft zu erreichen hoffen."
 HOL_red_scare: "Der Rote Schrecken"
 HOL_red_scare_desc: "Die Bedrohung, die die Kräfte des Sozialismus und des verräterischen Syndikalismus für unsere Lebensweise darstellen, darf nicht unterschätzt werden. Es ist an der Zeit, dass wir damit beginnen, dies den Menschen klar zu machen, wenn sie nicht bereits eine Tatsache begriffen haben, die so grundlegend und unveränderlich ist wie die Schwerkraft selbst."
 HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod: "Änderung des Beamtenverbot"
 HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod_desc: "Das Verbot des öffentlichen Dienstes hat sich als unzureichend erwiesen, um unser zerbrechliches politisches System vor Unterwanderung zu schützen. Indem wir die zugrunde liegenden Rechtsvorschriften zu unseren Gunsten ändern, können wir den Einfluss linker Gruppen auf den Staatsapparat schwächen."
 HOL_influence_legal_system: "Untergrabung des Rechtssystems"
 HOL_influence_legal_system_desc: "Gefährliche Zeiten verlangen nach verzweifelten Maßnahmen. Auch wenn es dem konservativen Element in unserer Regierung sehr weh tut, ist es unabdingbar, dass der Einfluss der Regierung auf das Rechtssystem und die Justiz des Landes ausgeweitet wird, damit wir die Bedrohungen, mit denen wir konfrontiert sind, bewältigen können."
 HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF: "Die Landwacht auflösen"
 HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF_desc: "Die Landwacht hat sich mit den nationalistischen Interessen des VNH gegen den Staat verbündet, und deshalb müssen sie niedergeschlagen werden - notfalls mit Gewalt. Die einzigen Paramilitärs, die in Holland operieren dürfen, sind unsere eigenen."
 HOL_syndie_crackdown: "Syndikalistische Razzien"
 HOL_syndie_crackdown_desc: "Unsere Nation hat jahrelang zugelassen, dass diejenigen, die ihr Schaden zufügen wollen, unbehelligt durch ihre Straßen ziehen. Diese traurige Situation muss ein Ende haben, wenn wir die Unabhängigkeit Hollands angesichts der verabscheuungswürdigen roten Kräfte, die im Süden und Westen gegen uns aufmarschieren, bewahren wollen."
 HOL_break_up_soc_pillar: "Die sozialistische Pfeiler zerschlagen"
 HOL_break_up_soc_pillar_desc: "Während die sozialistische Pfeiler bisher ein weitgehend tolerierbarer Brennpunkt für legitimere und weniger gewalttätige Meinungsverschiedenheiten gegen die konservative Herrschaft in Holland war, stellt sie eine Gefahr dar, die weit über die Summe ihrer Teile hinausgeht. In Institutionen wie den Gewerkschaften könnten sich Sympathisanten des Syndikalismus verstecken, und das ist untragbar."
 HOL_anthem_in_schools: "Obligatorische Hymne in Schulen"
 HOL_anthem_in_schools_desc: "Im Rahmen einer umfassenderen, systematischen Politik zur Förderung des Nationalismus im Lande gegen den Widerstand der Linken wurde ein interessanter Vorschlag unterbreitet; die Nationalhymne Het Wilhelmus soll in den Klassenzimmern Pflicht werden."
 HOL_new_flag_protocol: "Neues Flaggenprotokoll"
 HOL_new_flag_protocol_desc: "Eine einfache Möglichkeit, den niederländischen Stolz in unseren Landsleuten wieder zu entfachen, besteht darin, ein neues Flaggenprotokoll zu kodifizieren. Neue Regeln für den Umgang mit der Nationalflagge, einschließlich ihres Hissens, ihrer Behandlung und der strafrechtlichen Ahndung von Misshandlungen, wären billig, aber beliebt."
 HOL_nationalist_renaissance: "Nationalistische Wiedergeburt"
 HOL_nationalist_renaissance_desc: "Es braucht nicht viel, um einen Niederländer dazu zu bringen, sein Land zu lieben, schließlich ist es ein Land, das man leicht lieben kann. Dennoch ist es beeindruckend, wie schnell es einige einfache Maßnahmen geschafft haben, eine große Anzahl von Menschen für die politische Zukunft unseres Landes zu vereinen."
 HOL_queens_speech: "Die Ansprache der Königin"
 HOL_queens_speech_desc: "Während sich Ihre Majestät in den letzten Monaten meist aus der Politik herausgehalten hat, wie es ihrem Amt und ihrer königlichen Würde entspricht, wird immer deutlicher, dass das neue Regime auf Dauer Bestand haben wird, und es sieht so aus, als ob sie bald öffentlich ihre stillschweigende Unterstützung für dieses Regime verkünden könnte, zumindest für den Moment."
 HOL_secret_police: "Geheimpolizei einrichten"
 HOL_secret_police_desc: "Der derzeitige staatliche Sicherheitsapparat ist für unsere Bedürfnisse unzureichend, so viel ist klar. Durch die Schaffung eines völlig neuen Zweigs der Polizei, der mit Geheimdienst- und Militärabteilungen verbunden ist, können wir dazu beitragen, die Stabilität der Niederlande zu erhalten."
 HOL_papua_camps: "Papua Lager"
 HOL_papua_camps_desc: "Durch die Einrichtung neuer Gefangenenlager auf dem fernen Papua in unseren ostindischen Kolonien werden wir einen Ort haben, an den wir alle Syndikalisten, die eine Bedrohung für die Nation darstellen, verbannen können. Niemand würde so dumm sein, auf eine Insel voller Kannibalen und menschenfressender Kreaturen zu fliehen."
 HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard: "Versuch, die Landwacht zu legitimieren"
 HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard_desc: "Die Landwacht hat ein Imageproblem, so viel ist klar. Wenn wir jedoch versuchen, sie als Bürgerwehr darzustellen und diese Botschaft der Bevölkerung nahe zu bringen, könnte dies ausreichen, um ihre eklatanten Mängel zu überdecken. Die Reform der Landwacht als Organisation muss später erfolgen."
 HOL_outlaw_unions: "Verbot von Gewerkschaften"
 HOL_outlaw_unions_desc: "Die Gewerkschaften, diese Bastionen der syndikalistischen Ideologie, stellen eine existenzielle Bedrohung für unser Land dar. Durch die Verabschiedung von Gesetzen, die die Macht der Gewerkschaften so weit in Frage stellen, dass sie im Wesentlichen der Geschichte angehören, können wir ihren verachtenswerten Einfluss beenden."
 HOL_spreading_the_revolution: "Verteidigung der Revolution"
 HOL_spreading_the_revolution_desc: "Als syndikalistische Nation in Europa ist es unerlässlich, dass wir unsere Rolle im Kampf für die Arbeiterklasse spielen. Alles andere wäre eine grobe Vernachlässigung unserer Pflicht."
 HOL_English_Advisors: "Männer von R.E.D."
 HOL_English_Advisors_desc: "Die Männer von R.E.D. 'Revolutionärer Exportwegweiser' haben jahrelang im Verborgenen gearbeitet, um die GS III-Agentur der Kapitalisten zu umgehen und die Revolution zu unterstützen. Jetzt, da das Proletariat aufgetaucht ist, haben sie die Rolle gewechselt und helfen uns beim Wiederaufbau der Nederlander Volksleger (Niederländische Volksarmee)."
 HOL_Syn_Flood: "Prepare the Inundation Lines"
 HOL_Syn_Flood_desc: "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defences. Properly prepared, it will surely save us again: we have yet to see a tank that can cross water."
 HOL_Red_Sky: "Red Sky Initiative"
 HOL_Red_Sky_desc: "Though we are a nation of traders, and builders, our population is much smaller than those that are at the gates. We shall use shells not men to keep the enemies back, with our proud worker providing them at a steady pace."
 HOL_Red_Sky_1: "Smash the Pillars of Capitalisms"
 HOL_Red_Armour: "British Pantser Designs"
 HOL_Red_Armour_desc: "A gap has been left in our army in the execution of armoured warfare tactics, and tank designs. Though with British designs, and Dutch ingenuity, we the Dutch are seeking to bridge this gap."
 HOL_Red_Navy: "A New Navy"
 HOL_Red_Navy_desc: "Class Traitors, Reactionaries, Verraders. These are the names given to those who serve in Burgerlijk fleet, who are now cowering in [DEI.Getname]. They have left us with nothing, though we shall rebuild..."
 HOL_Red_Navy_New_Direction: "Eine neue Ausrichtung"
 HOL_Red_Navy_New_Direction_desc: "Though we lack a fleet, we have the facilities to build more. Though building Battleships, or Dreadnoughts is not within our means, a new direction has been sort."
 HOL_Red_Navy_AC: "Radikaler Ansatz"
 HOL_Red_Navy_AC_desc: "The cost benefit analysis to build new Battleships, and Pantserschip has shown that they are outdated as they leave the shipwrights. A bold, new radical approach would see \"Vlootplan Furstner\" reviewed, and implemented for our Navy."
 HOL_Red_Vesting: "De Rode Vesting"
 HOL_Red_Vesting_desc: "Reversing the defensive plans by Winkelman, will have our forts face the Germans, and not our comrades."
 HOL_Volkleger: "Die Volksarmee"
 HOL_Volkleger_desc: "We have removed our Burgerlijk officers, and those that sympathetic to their cause. We are now truly now an army for the people."
 HOL_Red_Missles: "Rocket Development"
 HOL_Red_Missles_desc: "Furthering our Red Sky Initiative - Rockets and similar ordnance are being researched and constructed to rain down upon our enemies."
 HOL_Red_Air: "Volk Luchtmacht"
 HOL_Red_Air_desc: "With many of our previous members of the Luchtmacht leaving, like our navy, we have been forced to start from scratch. Our only saving grace is they left the planes behind for us..."
 HOL_Red_Para: "Paratroepen"
 HOL_Red_Para_desc: "Brute force isn't required against our enemy, but precision, which our newly formed Paratroopers can provide."
 HOL_Syn_Guns: "Arms of the Proletariat"
 HOL_Syn_Guns_desc: "British arms are finding their way into the hands of Dutch Proletariat, who will drive the Prussians back."
 HOL_Red_Pillars: "Smash the Pillars of Capitalisms"
 HOL_Red_Pillars_desc: "As we smashed the pillars within our society, we must smash the pillars of capitalism. With our new arsenal, we shall do just that."
 HOL_Rembering_DBR: "De Bataafse Revolutie"
 HOL_Rembering_DBR_desc: "Our history is rife with the Germans, and all the forms they take, attempting to rob us of our freedom. We shall ensure the Dutch Proletariat is aware of these facts, regardless how \"embellished\" they are."
 HOL_CS6: "CS 6"
 HOL_CS6_desc: "The CS 6 was formed under the auspices of R.E.D agents, with the origin of its name lost. Its goal is to help preserve syndicalist ideology within [HOL.getname].. by any means"
 HOL_batavian_committee_of_science: "Batavian Committee of Science"
 HOL_batavian_committee_of_science_desc: "By nationalising the assets of research companies and placing them under the oversight of one committee by, for and with the people, we will be able to conduct research far more efficiently."
 HOL_dutch_researching: "Dutch Research Institute"
 HOL_dutch_researching_desc: "With Flanders in friendly hands, we can combine our research and share it faster with local scientists using the Dutch language. This will be a great boon to our research capabilities."
 HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred: "Exploit Royalist Sentiment"
 HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred_desc: "With the Queen's backing, our junta has been given the modicum of legitimacy that it needed to bring a number of undecided moderates over to our way of thinking. Now increasingly viewed as the saviours of a troubled nation, our position is becoming far safer."
 HOL_order_of_orange_nassau: "The Order of Oranje Nassau"
 HOL_order_of_orange_nassau_desc: "The chivalric Order of Orange-Nassau exists to reward those that give their all to the Dutch people, either on the battlefield or in the civilian sphere. With the support of the monarchy, we can begin to use the order for our own political and military ends."
 HOL_permanent_stability: "Permanent Stability"
 HOL_permanent_stability_desc: "It has become clear to all that there is no way that the people can be left to their own devices. Inevitably populist figures on the left and right will rise to hijack their passions and fears, plunging the nation into chaos. There is only one rational path forwards - an end to elections."
 HOL_restore_democracy: "Restore Democracy"
 HOL_restore_democracy_desc: "The dangers of syndicalism and populism have been averted. There is no more need for a reactionary junta and the time has come to restore democratic rule to the Netherlands."
 HOL_VNH_crackdown: "VNH Crackdown"
 HOL_VNH_crackdown_desc: "While the Landwacht has been suppressed, its insidious paymasters in the VNH still remain active in the country. It is not only leftist groups that pose a threat to our country, but nationalist groups too."
 HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag: "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
 HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag_desc: "VNH's reforms have been effective so far, and the country is recovering to some extent, both politically and economically. All the same, the events of 'Strange Saturday' might put an end to all previous notions of stability."
 HOL_staatsvakbond: "Staatliche Gewerkschaft"
 HOL_staatsvakbond_desc: "The Dutch people have a newfound sense of pride, however with the loss of traditional pillars and outlets such as the unions, their anger and zeal might be directed our way. By instituting new state-led trade unions, we can diffuse and disarm these feelings, and potentially redirect them towards our enemies."
 HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest: "Van Geelkerken's Arrest"
 HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest_desc: "With the failure of Van Geelkerken in his attempt to force the retirement of Swart, it is important that we seek to make as much political capital out of this as possible. By crushing a hard-line coup, our own moderate credentials have been burnished and our popularity has reached new heights."
 HOL_swarts_retirement: "Swart's Retirement"
 HOL_swarts_retirement_desc: "Van Geelerkerken has successfully deposed Swart from office and instigated a far more extremist brand of ideology upon the Netherlands. Surprisingly, this breath of fresh air appears to have gone down surprisingly well, particularly alongside convenient leaks of the secrets of various disgraced VNH loyalists."
 HOL_reform_landwacht: "Reform the Landwacht"
 HOL_reform_landwacht_desc: "The Landwacht has been incredibly effective in securing and defending our government. Unfortunately, it has several unsavoury elements within it that have cast a poor light on the rest of the paramilitary force as well as our own government. Things must change."
 HOL_landwacht_part_of_army: "Incorporate Landwacht into the Army"
 HOL_landwacht_part_of_army_desc: "For too long the rightful spoils of governing have been left to weaker men within the VNH and the army. If things are to change, we must set about assimilating our loyal Landwacht fighters into the regular army at every level. We must entrench our control over lesser fools."
 HOL_new_era: "The Dutch Stratocracy"
 HOL_new_era_desc: "We have saved the Netherlands from the abyss, and for that we should feel nothing but total elation. Unfortunately, peace is fleeting, and as such as we must set about linking government control with that of the military. Together, military and state will preserve the nation's greatness."
 HOL_dutch_apartheid: "Voor Leider en Vaderland!"
 HOL_dutch_apartheid_desc: "The cry goes out, 'for leader and fatherland!'. It booms from the rafters of the highest Amsterdam tower to the base of its lowest canal. Our new order is finally ready, and we are on the march. Voor Leider. Voor Vaderland."
 HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod: "Tighten the Beamtenverbot"
 HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod_desc: "The civil service ban has been insufficient in its goal of stemming the tide of extremist influence within our government and administration. We must legislate to make it more effective at snuffing out dangerous ideologies."
 HOL_entrench_pillarization: "Entrench Pillarisation"
 HOL_entrench_pillarization_desc: "The pillars are the foundation upon which Dutch society stands. Without them there can be no stability. At every opportunity we must embrace and bolster our cultural and democratic institutions."
 HOL_ban_paramilitaries: "Ban Paramilitary Groups"
 HOL_ban_paramilitaries_desc: "On both the left and right paramilitaries such as the Red Front and Landwacht have caused us disconcerting amounts of problems. This will end. Now."
 HOL_gov_support_for_pillars: "Support the Pillars"
 HOL_gov_support_for_pillars_desc: "We have begun implementing substantive acts and proposals intended to bolster the traditional pillars of Dutch society, for example through incentivising church attendance and encouraging Dutch footballers to travel for games overseas to the adulation of radio listeners."
 HOL_paramilitary_crackdown: "Suppress the Paramilitaries"
 HOL_paramilitary_crackdown_desc: "While we have implemented law banning paramilitary organisations, the time has come to truly enforce them. By cracking down hard on these undemocratic groups, we will strike a blow that will send the radicals scurrying back to their foreign paymasters. The security of the Netherlands depends on it."
 HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped: "The Pillars Preserved"
 HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped_desc: "Our efforts to inspire confidence in the traditional pillars have not gone unnoticed, and increasingly members of the public are coming to recognise the righteousness of our intervention in otherwise off-limit cultural and social affairs. Our actions are paying off."
 HOL_dissolution_of_NAS: "NAS Dissolution"
 HOL_dissolution_of_NAS_desc: "Outlawing the primary syndicalist party in the Netherlands is critical if our efforts are to have any chance of succeeding. Inspired by Communard French demagogues, this movement is a menace to all Dutch society."
 HOL_ban_RSAP: "Outlaw the RSAP"
 HOL_ban_RSAP_desc: "While the radical socialists are not quite as dangerous as other, more extreme left-wing groups, they are a danger to society. Their programmes and manifesto are persuasive to a number of lower-class workers and intellectuals, making them a key target."
 HOL_ban_patriotten: "Ban the Patriotten"
 HOL_ban_patriotten_desc: "The Patriotten are a virulent disease, the likes of which the Netherlands hasn't seen for many years. It is so radical that it poses as much as threat to other syndicalist ideologies as our own. Self-destructive impulses aside, we must suppress such groups."
 HOL_ban_VNH: "Verbot des VNH"
 HOL_ban_VNH_desc: "With the left pushed underground, it becomes increasingly important that we crush the far-right threat in this country once and for all. The VNH's more extreme elements turn an otherwise palatable group into a potential danger to the nation, and as such they must be brought down by law."
 HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds: "Launch Underground Raids"
 HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds_desc: "With many extremist groups forced underground, that leaves them with only one remaining place for us to target. We will launch a major police operation and bring down the remnants of these hateful groups, no matter the cost."
 HOL_stable_once_again: "Stable Once More!"
 HOL_stable_once_again_desc: "It has been a hard road, but with our serious ideological opposition now consigned to prison cells, foreign shores or an early grave, perhaps now the Netherlands might be able to rest easy."
 HOL_negotiate_with_the_left: "Negotiate with the Left"
 HOL_negotiate_with_the_left_desc: "If we are to ensure that politics in the Netherlands remains relatively unbesmirched by extremism, it is important that we consider negotiating with some of the more moderate elements of the left to ensure stability."
 HOL_limit_working_week: "Limited Welfare"
 HOL_limit_working_week_desc: "A number of limited welfare reforms and incentives might just be enough to get the leftist groups on side. The question is whether or not they are acceptable to all involved."
 HOL_limit_RNF: "Restrict the Red Front"
 HOL_limit_RNF_desc: "The left-wing Red Front paramilitaries pose a serious threat to civil order in our nation. We must demand some level of action be taken on them."
 HOL_limited_minimum_wage: "De-Facto Recognition of Syndicalists"
 HOL_limited_minimum_wage_desc: "A number of leftists regularly demand that we recognise syndicalist regimes such as that of the Commune of France. While de-jure recognition is unpalatable to many rightist groups, if not totally out of the question, perhaps token recognition could be proposed."
 HOL_limit_NAS: "Limit the NAS"
 HOL_limit_NAS_desc: "It is vital that we demand that at least some measures be taken against the NAS, a union of orthodox syndicalists that have the most moral legitimacy of most hard-left groups in the country. The question is, how far should we go in our demands?"
 HOL_protection_against_np: "Protection from the Landwacht"
 HOL_protection_against_np_desc: "The Landwacht are a distinctly nationalist group of paramilitaries that regularly cause serious harm to left-wing activists and street marchers. No doubt the negotiations will centre on us assisting the leftists against them in some manner."
 HOL_limit_socialist_parties: "Minimise Socialist Influence"
 HOL_limit_socialist_parties_desc: "One area that is critical for us is to limit the power of the radical socialist RSAP, the only hard-left group with parliamentary representation. They have a been a major thorn in our side, and so the negotiations would be a good chance of removing them."
 HOL_negotiations_succeeded: "Negotiations Succeeded!"
 HOL_negotiations_succeeded_desc: "Our willingness to concede on a few points, and the surprising willingness of our political rivals to come to terms, means that the negotiations have proven to be a relative success for all involved."
 HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right: "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Right"
 HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right_desc: "With the power of the leftists limited to a reasonable extent by our negotiations, it is time for us to unite against the forces of far-right extremism within the Netherlands."
 HOL_democratic_survival: "Dutch Democracy is Saved!"
 HOL_democratic_survival_desc: "After months of brutal negotiations it appears that some level of stability is finally returning to Dutch politics."
 HOL_negotiate_with_the_right: "Negotiate with the Right"
 HOL_negotiate_with_the_right_desc: "Though it might not be an ideal situation, we would be best placed to negotiate with less extremist elements of the nationalist VNH movement in order to bring some measure of peace to Dutch politics."
 HOL_limit_landwacht: "Limit Landwacht Activities"
 HOL_limit_landwacht_desc: "A key part of the deal rests on the Landwacht, the right-wing VNH paramilitary group responsible for breaking leftist skulls in recent street marches. While we could demand that they be dissolved, pushing the point too hard might alienate even some relatively moderate VNH members."
 HOL_limit_union_rights: "Curtail Union Rights"
 HOL_limit_union_rights_desc: "If there is one thing that we can all agree on, it is that the threat posed by syndicalism and its trade union backers is existential. However, the VNH's demands that we seriously damage them might prove to be destabilising anathema to the Dutch working class."
 HOL_limit_influence_military: "Reduce Military Influence"
 HOL_limit_influence_military_desc: "A number of senior army figures are public members of the VNH, even if less politically noxious than others. All the same, we must make limiting the VNH's influence on our armed forces contingent on any deal we sign with them. We cannot allow the risk of a coup."
 HOL_limited_tariffs: "Lower Tariffs"
 HOL_limited_tariffs_desc: "The VNH has demanded that we lower economic tariffs on imported goods, somewhat contrary to their nationalist leanings. While doing so might gain their support, it may prove to be unpopular with the people once cheap goods flood onto the market undercutting local businesses."
 HOL_limit_populist_parties: "Limit Populist Parties"
 HOL_limit_populist_parties_desc: "One demand that we must make of the VNH is to consider their position on allowing constant party rallies. At these rallies, a number of young Dutchmen are being radicalised by more extremist elements within the VNH."
 HOL_limit_foreign_assets: "Nationalise German Assets"
 HOL_limit_foreign_assets_desc: "Unbelievably, one of the VNH's demands is that we seize German property in the country. Though this might be incredibly dangerous, the VNH have made it a major demand, and as such we cannot simply ignore it."
 HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded: "Negotiations Succeeded!"
 HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded_desc: "It appears that the more moderate wing of the VNH were not so unreasonable after all. With their support in neutralising the threat from the far-right elements within the nationalist movement, we can now turn our attention to promoting peace throughout the Dutch political system."
 HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left: "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Left"
 HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left_desc: "It is all in place now. With support from moderate and right groups, we can stem the malign influence of radical left groups within our proud nation. It seems that finally the Netherlands will be stable once more."

 HOL_dutch_army_focus: "The Dutch Army"

 HOL_dutch_GS_III: "Expand the GS III"
 HOL_dutch_GS_III_desc: "Third Department of the General Staff was established during the early days of the Weltkrieg. Its goal was to ensure monitor both the Central Powers, or the Entente, to provide insight in the goings-on, and to ensure no ill will was to be directed at the Netherlands. Now with Radicalism on the rise, the GS III has been called on again to defend the Netherlands from enemies that are both foreign and domestic..."
 HOL_Mil_Acad: "Koninklijke Militaire Academie"
 HOL_Mil_Acad_desc: "The Royal Military Academy (KAM) has been supplying the Army, and the Marechaussee (National Police) with fresh commissioned officers since 1828. With the Weltkrieg over, and with many officers on both sides of the conflict now retiring. We should seek them to impart their knowledge, and experiences on our cadets, to better them."
 HOL_land_doctrine_defensive: "Focus on Defence"
 HOL_land_doctrine_defensive_desc: "Our land is a brutal morass, a place of swamps, marshes and sturdy men. By playing to the Netherlands' strengths, we shall make our enemies bleed for every inch they take."
 HOL_kai: "Expand the Artillerie Inrichtingen"
 HOL_kai_desc: "The Koninklijke Artillerie Inrichtingen are vital for our army. We need to reopen production lines so we can start replacing our old equipment with modern materiel."
 HOL_anti_tank_focus: "New Anti-Tank Guns"
 HOL_anti_tank_focus_desc: "If we are to hold out against a superior foe, we need weapons capable of penetrating even the mightiest of Panzers. We must invest into anti-tank weaponry and its research."
 HOL_artillery_focus: "Artillery Modernisation"
 HOL_artillery_focus_desc: "Our defensive measures have no use if we have no big guns to back them up. And these guns from the 19th century we have now will make nice museum pieces."
 HOL_korps_luchtafweer: "Anti-Aircraft Guns"
 HOL_korps_luchtafweer_desc: "We cannot hope to match the superpowers in terms of aerial capabilities. We must invest in a network of defensive gun emplacements and flak towers."
 HOL_vesting_holland: "Reinforce the Vesting Holland"
 HOL_vesting_holland_desc: "Our defences should hold, but it would be foolish of us to hope that in their current state they would prove effective enough against invading armies. Further investment into our fortifications is paramount."
 HOL_study_defence_plans: "Study Defence Plans"
 HOL_study_defence_plans_desc: "As a small coastal nation, we have always anticipated attack from the sea, but new threats on the global stage are forcing us to deal with potential land invasions as well. We need to make better plans for the defence of the Netherlands."
 HOL_mobilisation_preparation: "Mobilisation Preparations"
 HOL_mobilisation_preparation_desc: "Revisiting our mobilisation timetables and preparations will allow us to be ready for war should the need arise."
 HOL_reinforce_divisions: "Regiment Stoottroepen"
 HOL_reinforce_divisions_desc: "The infiltration tactics used by the German army in the Weltkrieg, have made their way into the Dutch army with the expansion of a shock troop regiment."
 HOL_infantry_focus: "Rifles and Boots"
 HOL_infantry_focus_desc: "Our infantrymen are the bedrock on which our army is based. We must give them all of the support we can so that they aren't forced to march into battle with little more than broomsticks and sandals."
 HOL_machine_guns: "New Machine Guns"
 HOL_machine_guns_desc: "Our machineguns belong in a museum, and it is high time we acquire some new ones!"
 HOL_land_doctrine_mobile: "A Mobile Army"
 HOL_land_doctrine_mobile_desc: "Our flat land makes mechanised and armoured divisions a no-brainer. By investing further into this area and applying new military doctrine to our army, the Netherlands can become a force to be reckoned with."
 HOL_gemotoriseerde_huzaren: "The Gemotorizeerde Huzaren"
 HOL_gemotoriseerde_huzaren_desc: "While once horses were the choice of the cavalrymen of their day, we need new vehicles for a new breed of hussars to bring death to our enemies."
 HOL_bicycle_army: "Bicycles For our Soldiers"

 HOL_pantserkorps: "Pantserkorps Formation"
 HOL_pantserkorps_desc: "The people like to see that we are spending their tax money in new fields. By publicly demonstrating our resolve to form a new armoured force, we might just be able to win some kudos."
 HOL_korps_pioniers: "Korps Pioniers"
 HOL_korps_pioniers_desc: "The Pioneer Corps are the jewel in our military crown. All the same, we must invest further time and energy into these men, if we are to make the most advantage from their talents."
 HOL_korps_verkenners: "Integrated Recon Battalions"
 HOL_korps_verkenners_desc: "More important than being able to fight, is knowing where your enemy is before they detect you. By integrating recon companies into our divisions, we shall give our forces a crucial edge."
 HOL_armoured_cars: "Pantrado M39 Armoured Cars"
 HOL_armoured_cars_desc: "Armoured Cars are a cheap and efficient way of scouting the battlefield and providing cheap transport for our troops. We need to extend our research into the design and production of better models."
 HOL_requisition_trucks: "van Doorne's Aanhangwagen Fabriek"
 HOL_requisition_trucks_desc: "DAF Trucks are a vital part of an economy based on exports and have recently won a military contract to further expand the M39 fleet."
 HOL_Genietroepen: "Genietroepen"
 HOL_Genietroepen_desc: "The more moving parts in our Army, the more military engineers are required to keep it moving forward... or rolling in some cases."
 HOL_integ_support: "Integrated Support Elements"
 HOL_integ_support_desc: "With the integration of support elements, our forces can thurst deeper into enemy territory."
 HOL_study_mobile_tactics: "Study Mobile Tactics"
 HOL_study_mobile_tactics_desc: "We are now starting to get all this new and expensive machinery, but we have no experience actually using it! We should study the usage of mobile truck divisions and tanks otherwise it is all for nothing."
 HOL_mech_infantry: "Braat Overvalwagen"
 HOL_mech_infantry_desc: "Developed in the Dutch East Indies, the Braat Overvalwagen is cheap enough to make armoured personnel carrier. We can consider adopting this design for the mainland army as well."

## Navy
 HOL_dutch_navy: "The Dutch Navy"
 HOL_dutch_navy_desc: "As we move into an era beyond the Weltkrieg, we will need to decide how our navy develops. There are multiple plans on the table, we will have to evaluate each one and decide on the best."
 HOL_vlootplan_furstner: "Vlootplan Furstner"
 HOL_vlootplan_furstner_desc: "We must radically alter our navy's composition. It is being made increasingly clear that battleships are being made redundant by the ever-improving potency of the airplane. We need to expand on our existing carrier and her capabilities, and if possible, acquire more naval airpower!"
 HOL_gateway_to_europe: "Gateway to Europe"
 HOL_gateway_to_europe_desc: "Our ports have always seen the goods of the world flow through it, and onto mainland Europe. We shall expand upon our ports and drydocks in [36.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to further expand our capital."
 HOL_de_schelde: "Koninklijke de Schelde"
 HOL_de_schelde_desc: "The area around Vlissingen is perfect for our new shipyard expansion. First built in 1875, it has traditionally focused on repair and resupply, but it's high time we made it into a large construction area as well."
 HOL_dd_furstner: "Escort Destroyer"
 HOL_dd_furstner_desc: "Our carrier and other capital ships are slow lumbering targets and can easily be torpedoed if left unguarded. We need to ensure that our destroyers are up for that task."
 HOL_claa_furstner: "Anti-Aircraft Light Cruiser"
 HOL_claa_furstner_desc: "We need ships to shoot enemy planes out of the skies to protect our fleet. A cruiser sized design is perfect for that. We can specialise our future cruiser designs to have less guns pointing at the sea, and more into the skies!"
 HOL_carrier_tactics: "Carrier Tactics"
 HOL_carrier_tactics_desc: "We have a carrier force, but never properly studied how to use them effectively. We should remedy this at once."
 HOL_fleet_carrier: "The Gouden Leeuw"
 HOL_fleet_carrier_desc: "The HrMs Gouden Leeuw is truly the pride of our navy. The lone carrier gives us a massive boost in our capabilities, but other navies have more and bigger carriers than her. We can press her to the limit and try to get more planes in the hangar, or we can attempt to get a new one!"

 HOL_vlootplan_helfrich: "Vlootplan Helfrich"
 HOL_vlootplan_helfrich_desc: "We simply do not possess the means to compete with Japan or any other major navy on the surface waters, hence Admiral Helfrich proposes that we outfit our navy with the ships we can also build best, submarines, and harass enemy mercantile shipping and troop transports while we protect our own!"
 HOL_protect_merchant_marine: "Protect our Merchant Marine"
 HOL_protect_merchant_marine_desc: "Our merchant marine is vital to the survival of the country. Without it, we are cut off from our colonies and maritime trade with the rest of the world. Being able to escort the vulnerable cargo ships is thus critical. To effectively protect the convoys, we need to think about suitable ships and tactics to deploy said ships effectively."
 HOL_destroyer_escort_asw: "Anti-Submarine Destroyer"
 HOL_destroyer_escort_asw_desc: "By far the greatest danger to our merchant fleet is not via the air, nor the few odd commerce raiders about, but hiding underwater until it might be too late to act. We thus must outfit our destroyers with the latest Anti-Submarine equipment to deal with this threat."
 HOL_destroyer_escort_aa: "Anti-Aircraft Destroyer"
 HOL_flotilla_leader: "Flotilla Leader"
 HOL_flotilla_leader_desc: "Large ships are expensive, and we shall never be able to build enough for our needs. It thus has been proposed to build a new class of ship, the 'flotilla leader'. Either a small cruiser or a large destroyer in size and thus comparatively cheap, packed with enough firepower to destroy enemy fast surface raiders and dangers lurking under water."
 HOL_civilian_convoys: "Requisition Civilian Cargo Ships!"
 HOL_civilian_convoys_desc: "We are at war, and we will need every ship we can muster to keep supplies flowing and moving our troops around!"

Furthermore, smaller surface ships can also be built at the shipyard, giving us exactly the ships we need... and can afford."
 HOL_submarine_snorkel: "O Class Submarines"
 HOL_submarine_snorkel_desc: "Our submarines are going to be designed mainly for operation in the Atlantic. We need them to be stealthy and hit hard to be able to compete with naval powers like Germany, the Commune of France, and the Union of Britain."
 HOL_submarine_colonial: "K Class colonial submarines"
 HOL_submarine_colonial_desc: "Our empire stretches far, so our submarines need to reach far. We thus need replacement for our ageing colonial submarines, and we need more of them!"
 HOL_ship_a_day: "Ship a Day Tactics"
 HOL_ship_a_day_desc: "Our submarines are high in quality, but low in quantity compared to other major seafaring nations. We thus must use each one at its fullest. Admiral Helfrich intends to push every submarine and crew to its limits by aggressively sailing out, and by using unconventional tactics as diving into enemy harbours and torpedoing everything in sight."
 HOL_wolfpack: "Wolfpack"
 HOL_wolfpack_desc: "Our submarines should form small groups so they can pick of multiple targets. Should this 'wolfpack' be detected though, this could also mean that multiple submarines cannot escape safely..."
 HOL_lonewolf: "Independent Operations"
 HOL_lonewolf_desc: "Our submarines should always operate separately in a spread-out manner. This reduces the damage potential of a successful raid, but also makes them harder to detect and might force the enemy to spread-out."

 HOL_vlootplan_doorman: "Vlootplan Doorman"
 HOL_vlootplan_doorman_desc: "The navy is crucial for our survival, and we will need all the firepower we can get. Having an assortment of smaller ships and outdated cruisers will not be enough, we must invest into proper cruisers and our battleship force."
 HOL_wilton_fijenoord: "Wilton Fijenoord"
 HOL_wilton_fijenoord_desc: "The NV Dok en Werf Maatschappij Wilton-Fijenoord is in Schiedam, west of Rotterdam. With its origins tracing back to the first half of the 19th century and was the first Dutch shipbuilding company to use steamer turbines. It is responsible for building most of the Dutch cruisers, as well as some destroyers and submarines."
 HOL_cl_doorman: "Kijkduin Class Cruisers"
 HOL_cl_doorman_desc: "Our previous cruiser designs are either old or just outgunned and too thinly armoured. It is time the Dutch navy gets some truly modern cruisers to form the backbone of the navy."
 HOL_pantserschip: "A New Pantserschip"
 HOL_pantserschip_desc: "Our old armoured cruisers are either rusting away at the docks or converted to other uses. We can study reviving this type of ship as they can be used as capable coastal defence ships or cruiser killers, or simply as a cheaper alternative to expensive battleships."
 HOL_dn_doorman: "Our Battleships"
 HOL_dn_doorman_desc: "Our five Battleships were constructed during the 1920s. While we lack the knowledge to build such majestic ships from the ground up, we can refit them to improve their capabilities, or ask German ship wharfs to come up with new designs for us."
 HOL_doctrine_doorman: "Capital Ship Training"
 HOL_doctrine_doorman_desc: "The new large-scale ships we are building will necessitate a lot of new training for the crew, and there are a lot of crew as well! We need to implement a new training regimen for all the new sailors needed by this large ocean-spanning fleet."

## Air Force
 HOL_dutch_airforce: "The Dutch Air Force"
 HOL_dutch_airforce_desc: "Airpower has already shown to be useful in the Weltkrieg, and we can only anticipate its need increasing. We need to lay a firm foundation for airpower in the Netherlands to keep up with foreign enemies."
 HOL_luchtvaartacademie: "KAM Air Academie"
 HOL_luchtvaartacademie_desc: "The Air Force is still lacking an organised education system for pilots and officers alike. By setting up the Luchtvaartacademie (Air Academy) within the Royal Military Academy we can improve the tactical operations of the air force considerably."
 HOL_gilze_rijen_airbase: "Gilze-Rijen Air Base"
 HOL_gilze_rijen_airbase_desc: "The LVA only has one proper airbase for military use, Airbase Soesterberg. Although centrally located, storing all our airplanes is not ideal. Developing the already existing airstrip at Gilze-Rijen will give our air force an additional base."
 HOL_koolhoven: "Koolhoven"
 HOL_koolhoven_desc: "Koolhoven Vliegtuigen Fabriek N.V. situated in Rotterdam, has delivered some smaller airplane types for our air force in the past, mostly trainer planes. However, Koolhoven shows potential, and we can consider giving them a chance to supply our air force with much needed modern planes."
 HOL_koolhoven_fighter: "Koolhoven Fighters"
 HOL_koolhoven_fighter_desc: "As we have opted for Koolhoven as our chief designer for the air force, we should start with replacing our antiquated fighter force with new planes from Koolhoven."
 HOL_koolhoven_naval_bomber: "Koolhoven Naval Bombers"
 HOL_koolhoven_naval_bomber_desc: "Airplanes with torpedoes attached are the bane of any ship, especially the big and lumbering ones. Koolhoven has a rough concept of a promising twin-engine naval bomber design, which are perfect for patrolling near the coast for enemy shipping."
 HOL_fokker: "Fokker"
 HOL_fokker_desc: "Fokker, situated in Amsterdam, has long been a dominant force in the civil aviation market. We should take the designs and adopt them for military use, lending our fighter craft extended range, agility, and firepower."
 HOL_fokker_fighter: "Fokker Fighters"
 HOL_fokker_fighter_desc: "The Fokker D.XVII forms the bulk of our fighter squadrons, and it has served well as a sturdy and agile machine. Now it is time for a replacement suitable for our needs, and who can do that better than Fokker!"
 HOL_fokker_jachtkruiser: "Fokker Jachtkruisers"
 HOL_fokker_jachtkruiser_desc: "A twin-engine fighter might not be as fast and nimble, yet the proposed 'Jachtkruisers' by Fokker carry a deadly pack of machineguns, have a much longer range and can potentially be equipped with a bomb load of their own, making them versatile planes."
 HOL_fokker_ontwerp_115: "Finish Ontwerp 115 Bomber"
 HOL_fokker_ontwerp_115_desc: "Fokker has design plans in an advanced stage for a true four-four-engine bomber. We can order a prototype to be built and then see if we will actually build this behemoth for our air force."
 HOL_new_bomber: "A New Bomber"
 HOL_new_bomber_desc: "The LVA needs a new bomber as those in service are not particularly modern, or even useful. However, but we lack the capacity to have multiple types and should pick one suitable for our needs. Quick and nimble close air support planes, or continue with the Luchtkruiser twin-engine bomber concept?"
 HOL_cas_tactics: "Huisje-Boompje-Beestje Tactics (Haus-Baum-Tier-Taktiken)"
 HOL_cas_tactics_desc: "Indem sie sehr niedrig fliegen, sind unsere relativ langsamen Bomber wesentlich schwerer zu entdecken und haben somit eine höhere Chance, ihr Ziel zu erreichen. Es sei denn, sie treffen einen Baum..."
 HOL_tactical_tactics: "Luchtkruiser Tactics"
 HOL_tactical_tactics_desc: "Our twin-engine planes are not just simple bombers, with their 20mm cannon installed in the nose installed they are like the cruisers of the air! They might not be fast, but can be a serious threat to other bombers, as well as enemy fighters who decide to attack them frontally!"
 HOL_carrier_planes: "Carrier Plane Variants"
 HOL_carrier_planes_desc: "The Gouden Leeuw is useless without proper planes, and she is starting to become so with her biplanes in her hanger. Koolhoven has offered us some designs which can be quickly adopted for carrier usage."

### Events ###
 holst.1.t: "The Netherlands in 1936"
 holst.1.d: "The Netherlands was one of the few countries in Europe to preserve its neutrality in the Weltkrieg, despite discussions about joining the war on the side of Germany. Though the Netherlands profited greatly from the post-Weltkrieg economic boom, a considerable part of its economy is now in German hands, with large-scale investments held by German companies. Furthermore, leftist ideas have been gaining serious traction in the Netherlands ever since the fall of France and Britain to Syndicalism in the 1920s, with reactionary ideologies also gaining momentum. Dutch democracy will surely be tested by rising global tensions and any collapse in the nation's economic prosperity."
 holst.1.a: "Leve de koningin!"

 holst.2.t: "Berlin Stock Market Crashes!"
 holst.2.d: "On February 3rd, 1936, the Berlin stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Already it is being labelled the so-called 'Black Monday' crash. Our nation has strong economic ties to the Reich and many German companies are now shutting down their Dutch factories, plunging hundreds of thousands into immediate unemployment. Our banks were greatly exposed to the impact of the Crisis, and its effects are already becoming evident across most of the country."
 holst.2.a: "This could be bad."

 holst.3.t: "Jordaan Riots"
 holst.3.d: "The Jordaan district of Amsterdam, traditionally a socialist stronghold, has erupted into violence.\n\nDissatisfaction with the inadequate unemployment provisions provided by the current government have, likely after prodding and agitation by syndicalist or council communist organisations, boiled over into a public protest. The protest turned into a riot as several groups of young men in black uniforms appeared out of the alleyways and descended upon the crowd with clubs, bricks and broken bottles.\n\nWith the police unable to restore order, the mayor was forced to call in several army units to disperse the crowds."
 holst.3.a: "Things are breaking down!"

 holst.4.t: "Lijst Links: The VDB-SDAP Electoral Pact"
 holst.4.d: "The formation of the overwhelmingly powerful right-wing CNA sent shockwaves through parliament and society alike. As expected, it is proving an unpopular move with many of the more devout believers, who have jumped ship to the smaller religious opposition parties, and many fringe political commentators decry it as either a desperate attempt to gain absolute power or the last gasp of a dying system. Still, the CNA enjoys a comfortable majority of public support.\n\nIn response to the change, the moderate opposition parties have been performing manoeuvres of their own. The SDAP, despite slowly losing members to the radicals, is still the largest political party outside of the CNA itself, and the VDB has been significantly strengthened by becoming the primary focus of liberal politics, but neither is large enough to take the CNA head-on. As such, in order to safeguard the ideals of liberalism, social democracy and the moderate left in general, the VDB and SDAP have announced their cooperation in the coming elections.\n\nTogether, the parties may not be as huge as the CNA, but they have the benefit of a solid foundation, while the CNA is still bleeding votes. Despite both being left-wing parties, their viewpoints are too far apart to truly merge as the CNA has done, but this Left List still offers the possibility of a moderate victory at the ballot box, providing an alternative to the ungainly right-wing bloc that is the CNA, which is shrinking by the day, and fringe organisations like the VNH and the Patriotten."
 holst.4.a: "Mijn hemel!"

 holst.5.t: "Falling Living Standards"
 holst.5.d: "Ever since February 3rd, Black Monday, and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, the economy of the Netherlands has been suffering. Our reliance on Germany has resulted in many of our workers becoming unemployed as German companies choose to cut jobs in the Netherlands first, spreading syndicalist ideas among the population. As a result, the Social Democratic Workers' Party, or SDAP, has been gaining many new members and its political power is increasing. Many of their ideas have merit, but to pass them we would have to bring them into the governing coalition - a potentially dangerous option."
 holst.5.a: "This does not bode well..."

 holst.6.t: "Crumbling of the Pillars"
 holst.6.d: "Dutch society has long been highly stratified into distinct social groups, referred to as 'pillars'. These pillars all have their own social institutions: their own newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, scouting organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology. This has led to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people outside their own pillar.\n\nHowever, the recent economic crisis has shaken the established order to its core. Economic hardship has spread socialist ideology beyond its established pillar, with syndicalists and council communists emboldened by the rhetoric emanating from Paris. At the same time, many young and unemployed from the more traditionally rightist pillars are feeling disenfranchised and abandoned by their condition, turning instead to radical nationalist parties such as the Alliance for National Reconstruction, the VNH, to restore stability and prosperity to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."
 holst.6.a: "Dear God, no!"

 holst.7.t: "Formation of the Christelijke Nationale Alliantie"
 holst.7.d: "For decades, the Dutch parliament has been dominated by the various religious parties. The Calvinist ARP and CHU and Catholic RKSP have held a convincing majority in the government, and have been the source of almost all ministerial appointments.\n\nHowever, they can no longer count on the unconditional and unwavering support of their respective pillars. While still dominant in their own spheres, they are losing ground to the far-left and far-right fringe movements, and even among the moderate audience, the pull of the left-liberals and social-democrats is growing. With each of these parties bleeding votes, and despite their pillars' strict separation in daily life, they are now attempting to cash in on their decades-long cooperation by erasing their party lines.\n\nThe formation of the Christian National Alliance, or CNA, is likely going to cost them more votes in the long run, but the consolidation of parliamentary seats and popular support still makes the CNA a political juggernaut that dwarfs all other parties.\n\nTime will tell whether this will be enough to counteract the increasing erosion of their voter base, or whether the primacy of God in politics is coming to an end..."
 holst.7.a: "United in faith."

 holst.8.t: "The Liberal Crisis"
 holst.8.d: "Liberalism in the Netherlands is under siege. The largest liberal party, the traditionalist LSP, has been steadily losing ground over recent years. Many members, disillusioned by the perceived failures of the old system, are being drawn to the radical nationalists of the VNH and now also the promise of a large power bloc like the CNA. This has led to the left-leaning VDB becoming the largest liberal party in the country, as they are losing members at a much slower rate.\n\nAlthough there is little likelihood of them winning the elections this year, there is still hope in the LSP that they can portray themselves as a credible moderate alternative to the conservative and increasingly authoritarian CNA."
 holst.8.a: "Troubling times, but the torch of liberalism is not yet extinguished."

 holst.9.t: "Rise of the Radical Left"
 holst.9.d: "After SDAP co-founder P.J. Troelstra's abortive attempt at founding a Dutch Republic in 1918, and the non-committal response by the party's moderate wing, the more radical revolutionary elements have abandoned the social democrats in order to pursue their hopes of overthrowing the old system in more like-minded company.\n\nThe SDAP's slight drift rightwards has only emboldened their radical counterparts in the Revolutionair-Socialistische Arbeiderspartij, or RSAP, a relatively small party in parliament that sees itself as Troelstra's successors, working within the system to overthrow it.\n\nEven further to the left, and outside the realm of conventional parliamentary politics, the Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat, or NAS, is the primary syndicalist labour organisation in the Netherlands, seeking to replace the old system in its entirety and restructure it according to the French model, with tacit support from Paris.\n\nIn many ways similar, the council communists and their election-boycotting KAPD rally behind the astronomer and Marxist theorist Anton Pannekoek.\n\nThere are even some for whom the syndicalist/council-communist approach is too conservative; the 'Patriotten', authoritarian socialists led by David Wijnkoop and Paul de Groot, see themselves as the guardians of the revolution, claiming to intend to keep it away from its tendency of falling to a new 'elitism'. Many of their ideas are consistent with the ideology the Internationale recently codified as Vanguardism.\n\nWith all these factions vying for the chance to leave their own mark on the history of the Netherlands, the parliamentary democratic system is well and truly under siege from the left."
 holst.9.a: "More radical leftists? Good Lord!"

 holst.10.t: "Formation of the Landwacht"
 holst.10.d: "In the wake of the Jordaan Riot, the police very rapidly found out that the black-shirted youths who were laying into the crowd of protesters, and who disappeared the moment the soldiers turned up, were more than just random thugs. These figures represent the first public appearance of the Landwacht, a paramilitary organisation set up by the VNH, supposedly led directly by Cornelis van Geelkerken himself.\n\nSince the Jordaan, the Landwacht has popped up all over the country, standing watch at VNH rallies and assemblies, disrupting meetings of left-wing organisations, and occasionally fighting in the streets against their syndicalist counterparts, the Nationale Rode Front, or 'Red Front'. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially among the youth.\n\nThe Landwacht is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
 holst.10.a: "Mijn hemel!"

 holst.11.t: "The Death of Van Gybland Oosterhoff"
 holst.11.d: "The leader of the ultra-nationalist VNH, Van Gybland Oosterhoff, died today in his home in Amsterdam.\n\nHis last few years had seen a rapid rise in fortunes of the VNH, brought on by the economic struggles facing many in the country, fear of Syndicalism and disillusionment with democracy. However, the party he leaves behind is highly divided itself between the young, newer members of the party lead by Cornelis van Geelkerken and the older, more established segment possessing ties to the Dutch military and bureaucracy in the hands of H.N.A. Swart.\n\nSwart has been named the new party leader with van Geelkerken his deputy, and the pair look set to challenge the established parties for control of the Hague in the May elections - provided the two wings can keep working together."
 holst.11.a: "We must be careful with them..."

 holst.12.t: "Social Unrest in the Netherlands"
 holst.12.d: "The past few months have seen the growth of violent confrontations between the paramilitary bands of both the left and the right, with street fights an almost daily occurrence in the larger cities. Strikes are commonplace, with either the police or the Landwacht's 'Blackshirts' breaking the strikers' pickets. The police have failed to keep order, with the army often having to offer support, but this has only served to increase dissent and further civil disobedience. If the situation continues to escalate, the elections in May look set to be the most contentious in living memory."
 holst.12.a: "Bloody thugs!"

 holst.13.t: "The Zwolle Massacre"
 holst.13.d: "A socialist rally outside Zwolle, organised by local council communists, ended in tragedy, as one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who were trying to disperse the crowds. Four policemen died, and the police immediately returned fire on the crowd, killing two dozen strikers.\n\nAt dawn the next morning, the police, openly backed up by the local chapter of the Landwacht, arrested local socialist leaders en masse, including the nephew of Henk Sneevliet, founder and leader of the RSAP.\n\nThese actions have elicited further protests throughout the country, and even the VDB is calling on Prime Minister Colijn to publicly condemn what they refer to as 'illegal detentions'."
 holst.13.a: "The police did well in rounding up the troublemakers so quickly."
 holst.13.b: "These people are innocent, and must be released at once!"

 holel.1.t: "Dutch Elections"
 holel.1.d: "With the incidents in Amsterdam and Zwolle still fresh in people's memories, the parliamentary elections are going to be hotly contested this year, and the police are out in force to deter would-be troublemakers.\n\nThe CNA super-bloc currently has the strongest parliamentary position, but with the pillars teetering on the brink of destruction and haemorrhaging voters left and right their superiority at the ballot box is very much in question. However, Lijst Links, the combination of the left-liberals and moderate social democrats, can also count on a broad support base, perhaps even enough to dethrone the CNA. And there's always the spectre of radicalism waiting in the wings..."
 holel.1.a: "Lijst Links Dethrones the CNA Juggernaut!"
 holel.1.b: "CNA retains its dominance."
 holel.1.c: "VNH becomes the largest party."

 holel.2.t: "Moderate Left Cabinet"
 holel.2.d: "The Lijst Links electoral alliance has successfully and soundly defeated the CNA. The increasingly authoritarian stance of the Christian Right has led to a surge in support for the moderate left, and now Colijn and his bloated, oversized party have been sent packing.\n\nHowever, unlike the total monolithic unification of the CNA, Lijst Links was merely an electoral alliance of convenience, and the left-liberals of the VDB and social democrats of the SDAP still retain their separate parties, with their own programmes and ideals. The few half-hearted efforts made towards further unification have been shouted down, and so Lijst Links is no more.\n\nObviously, the SDAP was the larger side in this pact, and thus are in a position to choose who they'll work with. Queen Wilhelmina has informed them that she is only willing to give the post of Formateur to a social liberal, thus it's impossible for Albarda to become minister-president without an impasse in forming a new government."
 holel.2.a: "VDB-SDAP moderate coalition with Oud as PM."
 holel.2.b: "SDAP will work with the RSAP so Albarda becomes PM."

 holel.3.t: "Moderate Right Cabinet"
 holel.3.d: "The CNA gamble has paid off! Despite losing many voters, the confessional bloc proved to be large enough to sweep away the opposition. The godless socialists have been thoroughly cowed and appear to be laying low for the time being. Now the time has come to form the next government, the fourth Colijn cabinet.\n\nMany prominent CNA members are confident that this victory means that the CNA still carries the people's mandate, and should thus form a cabinet by itself - albeit one which is only barely in the majority. However, since our majority is only marginal, any dissent within the party itself could destabilise the cabinet that needs to be sturdy in these roaring times.\n\nDue to our reduced majority, the now-decimated LSP have proposed joining our cabinet to assist us in coalition, and some reactionaries are suggesting that this one electoral victory is not enough to deter the radical leftists. Some senior figures are even floating the idea of cooperating with the VNH to use their resources to stamp out the red menace."
 holel.3.a: "We'll work with the liberal LSP."
 holel.3.b: "Multi-party cabinets are by definition unstable!"
 holel.3.c: "The VNH will work."

 holel.4.t: "VNH Wahlsieg"
 holel.4.d: "In such trying times as these, it's no surprise the people clamour for strong leadership to guide them. The ideals of the VNH have proven to be a strong enough rallying point that we have trounced every one of our adversaries at the ballot box, and now we take upon ourselves the task of stamping out the spectre of international Syndicalism and restoring the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the status it deserves.\n\nThis is not going to be an easy road, however - in addition to the Red menace, the factional party politicians who spend their days chattering away in Parliament will likely be fighting us every step of the way as well for we lack parliamentary majority. We could assuage their concerns and form a proper coalition with the CNA, if only to pacify the public and make the transition easier, or we could let the Landwacht 'convince' parliament to give us emergency powers."
 holel.4.a: "Form a coalition with the CNA."
 holel.4.b: "'Convince' parliament with the Landwacht."

 holel.5.t: "Queen Wilhelmina Abdicates"
 holel.5.d: "Disillusioned with the unconventional outcome of the elections, Queen Wilhelmina has announced that she will abdicate.\n\nShortly after this announcement the demissionary Colijn cabinet then asked the new parliament to approve the financing of the crowning ceremony, yet the RSAP and republican wing of the SDAP voted the suggestion away.\n\nAfter the voting procedures Henk Sneevliet came outside to speak to the crowd of people and NRFers and declared that 'the queen has abdicated and the former government is rapidly packing its bags. The Dutch left has won!'\n\nThe day after the Red Front stopped other parliamentarians from entering parliament, and voted a completely rewritten, socialist, constitution in."
 holel.5.a: "Leve de Republiek!"

 holel.6.t: "Queen Wilhelmina Abdicates"
 holel.6.d: "Queen Wilhelmina was unwilling to give Albarda the post of Formateur, despite the fact that he had won a resounding victory in the elections. As a result, Albarda had announced that he would only take part in a coalition if he would become prime minister, meaning he would need to work with the RSAP.\n\nCritics are now saying Wilhelmina pushed Albarda into radicalism and many are demanding that she resigns, it wouldn't take long."
 holel.6.a: "Leve de Republiek!"
 holel.6.b: "Juliana is crowned and makes Albarda Formateur."

 holel.7.t: "General Reijnders Requests Support"
 holel.7.d: "We have been watching our small neighbour, the Netherlands, for quite some time. It has become apparent that the Dutch left has won this year's elections and that it may soon join find itself being ruled by syndicalists. This is a worrying development as the Ruhr area is heavily dependent on the Dutch harbour of Rotterdam.\n\nToday the leader of the Dutch armed forces, Izaak Reijnders, came here to ask for support to launch a putsch; this could be the perfect opportunity to ensure the Dutch government remains aligned with our interests. Others however argue that in those days of crisis it should not be Germany's place to mess with other countries, even less so when it would cost money or resources."
 holel.7.a: "Herr Reijnders can count on our support."
 holel.7.b: "Sadly, we cannot support you."

 holel.8.t: "Reijnders Launches a Military Putsch"
 holel.8.d: "While the last votes were being counted, General Reijnders suddenly seized control of the nation's primary radio broadcaster and unilaterally declared the country to be in 'state of emergency'.\n\nIn Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Groningen, soldiers were deployed to occupy strategic points, such as bridges and public buildings. The demissionary Colijn government was preparing its response when suddenly a putschist detachment of soldiers burst into the building and placed all ministers under house arrest.\n\nIn Groningen, the crisis lasted less than an hour, however, as a loyalist army group joined up with the NRF and several 'volunteer guards', driving the revolting putschists back to the city limits. Following this, more loyalist forces began to rendezvous and launch attacks on the military forces holding the key strong points across the nation."
 holel.8.a: "The loyalist counter-attack is routed."
 holel.8.b: "The putsch is successfully crushed."

 holel.9.t: "Generaal Reijnders Arrested"
 holel.9.d: "General Reijnders was apprehended at the border today, carrying documents showing that he was seeking German support to carry out a putsch, something he evidently didn't receive as he was returning by motor carriage rather than the plane he demanded.\n\nBecause of the successful arrest of Reijnders, any risk of a putsch by the military seems to have been averted, though it may be beneficial to assess what measures we can take to improve the loyalty of the army to our constitutionally-appointed government."
 holel.9.a: "See you in court, Reijnders!"

 holel.10.t: "Successful Military Putsch"
 holel.10.d: "The last loyalist strongholds have been broken and the country is firmly in our hands, now the question remaining is how the country shall be ruled henceforth.\n\nDemocracy is, at least for now, ruled out because the people would just vote in leftists to parliament, which is not what we want. The choice lies between whether we set up a military junta under the lead of Reijnders or whether we let the VNH, who had tacitly supported our putsch, set up a provisional government capable of rooting out the red menace that has nestled itself in our country.\n\nMany are afraid however that the VNH will not be too willing to give up their power once they have it. On top of that they also have an extremist branch that may seek to take advantage of such a situation to seize power for themselves, while this deal is of course based solely on agreement with the moderate military branch of the VNH."
 holel.10.a: "We shall set up a junta."
 holel.10.b: "The VNH shall save our country."

 hol.6.t: "Labour Strikes"
 hol.6.d: "The failure of the government to act has led to a number of labour strikes across the country. Most officials are confident however that they'll blow over once the German economy recovers, though concerns are spreading amongst much of the nation's middle classes."
 hol.6.a: "The police will control them."
 hol.6.b: "The people are right - we must act!"

 hol.7.t: "The Zwolle Massacre"
 hol.7.d: "A Socialist rally outside Zwolle was met by local police, who moved to disperse it. However, one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who returned fire into the crowd with their pistols. Four policemen and two dozen strikers were left dead, and the next day the local authorities hanged 4 SDAP leaders, all of whom were on the speaker's podium at the time. There are growing calls to compromise with the SDAP, as more and more of the population turns against the government."
 hol.7.a: "We shall stand fast!"
 hol.7.b: "Blood has been spilled, we must give in to the SDAP."

 hol.8.t: "The Plan for Labour"
 hol.8.d: "Now that the SDAP is in power, after being denied for twenty years by various right-wing coalitions, it can begin to implement its Plan for Labour, created after Black Monday to address deteriorating economic conditions. The Plan for Labour includes ideas to bolster employment, nationalise vital industries, and implement a system of unemployment benefits, by devaluating the Gilder and allowing the national debt to rise, alongside other more extreme methods."
 hol.8.a: "We've waited a long time for this day."

 hol.9.t: "Syndicalism Grows in the Netherlands"
 hol.9.d: "Labour strikes and brutal crackdowns by the police have fostered the growth of a large revolutionary movement in the Netherlands. If we give them support in the form of training and equipment, they may be able to overthrow the government."
 hol.9.a: "Give aid in overthrowing the reactionaries."
 hol.9.b: "There are some things that just shouldn't be tried..."

 hol.10.t: "Joint French-British Assistance for Dutch Syndicalists"
 hol.10.d: "The Commune of France has decided to support their Dutch comrades in the fight against reactionary government and they are asking us for our help. Together we can help the Dutch proletariat to rise up and smash monarchists and capitalists. On the other hand, this might increase the tensions in relations with Germany, leading even to war."
 hol.10.a: "Let's do this!"
 hol.10.b: "There are some things that just shouldn't be tried..."

 hol.11.t: "Syndicalist Revolution!"

 hol.13.t: "Syndicalist Takeover in The Netherlands!"
 hol.13.d: "Events in the Netherlands have reached the boiling point, and socialists have stormed the capital with French and British equipment and volunteers! The fate of the Dutch Royal family is yet unknown, as rumours say they intend to escape to the loyalist Dutch East Indies."
 hol.13.a: "Curse them!"

 hol.14.t: "The Revolution Succeeds in the Netherlands!"
 hol.14.d: "With the assistance of foreign arms and volunteers, syndicalist revolutionaries have seized control of the Netherlands and stormed the capital. While it is yet unclear what happened to the Dutch Royal family, it appears that they have fled the nation with their tails between their legs."
 hol.14.a: "Glory to the Proletariat!"

 hol.15.t: "Fate of the Royal Family"
 hol.15.d: "Following the successful takeover of the Netherlands by syndicalist militias together with parts of the armed forces, the Royal family used the ensuing chaos to avoid capture. We have received information that they are planning to escape to the remaining parts of the Dutch colonial empire to lead their fight against us from there. A select coterie of loyal revolutionaries plans to capture them before they flee from the Netherlands."
 hol.15.a: "The Royal Family successfully escapes the Netherlands!"
 hol.15.b: "The Royal Family is captured and brutally killed by the militia!"
 hol.15.c: "Indonesia, here I come!"

 hol.16.t: "Fate of the Dutch Caribbean"
 hol.16.d: "As syndicalist parties in the Netherlands were able to seize power with the assistance of outside forces, their colonial empire can be now used as a springboard to spread vile syndicalist influence into different parts of world. To prevent Syndicalism from gaining any influence in the Caribbean, we must seize the Dutch colonies of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten."
 hol.16.a: "Seize control of the Dutch Caribbean!"
 hol.16.b: "This might not be a good idea."

 hol.17.t: "Fate of the Dutch East Indies"
 hol.17.d: "As Syndicalist parties in the Netherlands were able to seize power with the assistance of outside forces, their colonial empire can be now used as a springboard to spread vile syndicalist influence into different parts of world. To prevent Syndicalism from gaining any influence in the Pacific, we must seize Borneo, Sumatra, and parts of Western New Guinea."
 hol.17.a: "Seize control of parts of the Dutch East Indies!"
 hol.17.b: "This isn't a time to be greedy."

 hol.18.t: "Fate of the Dutch East Indies"
 hol.18.d: "As syndicalist parties in the Netherlands were able to seize power with the assistance of outside forces, their colonial empire can be now used as a springboard to spread vile syndicalist influence into different parts of world. To prevent Syndicalism from gaining any influence in the Pacific, we must seize Borneo, Sumatra, and parts of Western New Guinea."
 hol.18.a: "Seize control of parts of the Dutch East Indies!"
 hol.18.b: "I think we're good..."

 hol.19.t: "West Indies Federation Seizes the Dutch Caribbean!"
 hol.19.d: "With our state in chaos following the syndicalist takeover, the West Indies Federation used this opportunity to seize control of the Dutch Caribbean. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop them due to their distance across the Atlantic Ocean and our scarce military forces in the region."
 hol.19.a: "Colonies are an imperialist fancy. Who cares?"
 hol.19.b: "War it is!"

 hol.20.t: "The Reich Seizes the East Indies!"
 hol.20.d: "As a result, of our recent revolution many of our colonies overseas are in disarray, and as such the German Admiralty have used the ensuing chaos to seize lucrative parts of our overseas empire in the East Indies. Already German East Asia forces have crossed the border and annexed entire swathes of Dutch land."
 hol.20.a: "A brutal loss, but there's nothing we can do now."
 hol.20.b: "The excuse we've been waiting for. Attack!"

 hol.21.t: "Australasia Seizes the East Indies!"
 hol.21.d: "Shockingly the Australasian Confederation appears to have taken the bold step of marching into our overseas colonies unopposed and taking possession of them. Marching through the rainforests of New Guinea and deploying from warships, entire swathes of the former Dutch empire have been seized overnight."
 hol.21.a: "A damn shame, but we cannot exactly stop them..."
 hol.21.b: "They will regret this. War!"

 hol.22.t: "Netherlands and the Entente"
 hol.22.d: "The Netherlands' hopeless position surrounded by hostile superpowers and being crushed under the weight of political extremism on both the left and right means that it has recently come to us requesting to join the Entente."
 hol.22.a: "They are welcome!"
 hol.22.b: "Only a Dutchman. No."

 hol.23.t: "Netherlands and the Reichspakt"
 hol.23.d: "Under threat from the political forces of left and right, and surrounded by the hostile forces of syndicalists in Britain and France, the Dutch have come to us requesting a military alliance. While they had once considered joining us during the Weltkrieg, it appears that the situation is currently dire enough for them come down on our side."
 hol.23.a: "The Dutch are our cousins. Welcome!"
 hol.23.b: "Nein."

 hol.24.t: "Dutch Government in Exile"
 hol.24.d: "After narrowly escaping capture by syndicalist militia the Royal family, together with many senior leaders, arrived in Java, declaring the creation of the Kingdom of Netherlands in exile which will one day liberate our homeland from Syndicalism!"
 hol.24.a: "A new beginning!"

 hol.25.t: "New Foreign Policy"
 hol.25.d: "The recent takeover by syndicalist scum has left the remnants of the once proud Dutch colonial Empire in a precarious position. To liberate our homeland from the syndicalist usurpers, we need to join one of major alliances. Which alliance shall we try to join?"
 hol.25.a: "We have special bonds with the Entente."
 hol.25.b: "We can cooperate with Japan."
 hol.25.c: "We need German support."
 hol.25.e: "We don't need any allies."

 hol.26.t: "Dutch Government-in-Exile Requests Entry into the Entente"
 hol.26.d: "The Dutch government-in-exile has announced recently that they want to join the Entente. It is not a completely unforeseen move because pro-Entente policy is popular in many circles including the ruling cabinet and the army. Do we want to allow the exiled royals to join our alliance?"
 hol.26.a: "A good idea!"
 hol.26.b: "This would be pointless."

 hol.27.t: "Dutch Government-in-Exile Requests Entry into the Prosperity Sphere"
 hol.27.d: "The Dutch government-in-exile has announced recently that they want to join our alliance. It is not a completely unforeseen move because pro-Japanese policy is popular in many circles including the ruling cabinet and army. Do we want to allow the exiled royals to join our alliance?"

 hol.27.b: "Westerners? No way."

 hol.28.t: "Dutch Government-in-Exile Requests Entry into the Reichspakt"
 hol.28.d: "The Dutch government-in-exile has announced recently that they want to join the Reichspakt. It is not a completely unforeseen move because pro-German policy is popular in many circles including the ruling cabinet and the army. Do we want to allow the exiled royals to join our alliance?"

 hol.30.t: "Japanese Refuses Entry into the Prosperity Sphere!"
 hol.30.d: "It seems the Japanese do not want us in their alliance..."
 hol.30.a: "Such a miserable mistake."

 hol.31.t: "Germany Refuses Entry into the Reichspakt!"
 hol.31.d: "It seems the Germans do not want us in their alliance..."
 hol.31.a: "Such a miserable mistake."

 hol.33.t: "Plan Lely Reclamation"
 hol.33.d: "With the Noordoost and Zuidoostpolder reclaimed, there is now ample room for growth in the Netherlands. Already a number of businesses have made clear their intention to seize the opportunities offered by this massive expansion in our nation's land area."

 hol.34.t: "Zuiderzee Reclaimed!"
 hol.34.d: "Today a final ceremony was held to mark the end of the Zuiderzee reclamation project as set out in Plan Lely. The nation has greatly expanded in terms of acreage and as such, there is far more land available for our farmers and industrial complex to expand on to."

 hol.35.t: "Noordoostpolder Work Begins"
 hol.35.d: "With funds allocated by parliament, work can now commence on the first phase of the land reclamation in the Zuiderzee. Some critics however raise questions about the timing of the project, due to the recent stock market crash."
 hol.35.a: "Carry on."
 hol.35.b: "Perhaps we should delay this for now."

 hol.36.t: "Noordoostpolder and Zuidoostpolder Works Begin"
 hol.36.d: "The parliament opted for a full execution of Plan Lely. This will reclaim large swathes of land for use of development and agriculture but comes at considerable cost to the treasury. Due to the Berlin stock market crash, widespread criticism from the press and opposition parties has been noted. Continuing the project might cause considerable turmoil."
 hol.36.a: "Carry on."
 hol.36.b: "Just reclaim the Noordoostpolder for now."
 hol.36.c: "Delay the plans indefinitely."

 hol.37.t: "Zuiderzee Reclamation"
 hol.37.d: "Parliament decided to opt for a full execution of Plan Lely as proposed as proposed. This will reclaim large swathes of land for use of development and agriculture but comes at considerable cost to the treasury. Due to the Berlin stock market crash, widespread criticism from the press and opposition parties has been rife. Continuing the project might cause considerable turmoil."
 hol.37.a: "Carry on, this is for the future of our country!"
 hol.37.b: "Revise the plan down to just the Noordoost and Zuidoostpolder."
 hol.37.c: "Just reclaim the Noordoostpolder for now."
 hol.37.e: "Delay the reclamation of the Zuiderzee indefinitely."

 hol.38.t: "Restoring Order in the Indies"
 hol.38.d: "Our recent policies in the Indies have caused great unrest, with a general revolt looming. Knowing the risk posed to our government in the event of the loss of our vital colonies, the cabinet has held an emergency meeting to decide on a course of action."
 hol.38.a: "Subdue the revolt, send in the military!"
 hol.38.b: "Dilute the Cultuurstelsel."

### Post '37 Election Events ###
 holpostel.1.t: "Binnenhof Fire"
 holpostel.1.d: "Marinus van der Lubbe, a syndicalist already notorious for his pyromania, has set fire to the Binnenhof, the seat of the Dutch government.\n\nAlready the VNH has called for a country-wide attack on left-wing elements of any kind and it remains to be seen whether we can avoid such an outcome after this.\n\nThe left meanwhile, has sought to prove that the fire was caused by the VNH in an attempt to frame them, but no one really considers that a realistic scenario, considering Van der Lubbe's history and the fact that he was apprehended at the very scene of the fire."
 holpostel.1.a: "Keep calm and carry on!"
 holpostel.1.b: "Declare a state of emergency!"

 holpostel.2.t: "Anti-Syndicalist Riots"
 holpostel.2.d: "The rhetoric of the VNH, and especially its deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken, seems to have taken grip on the Dutch populace. Moderates who earlier might have dismissed the party as paranoid radicals have now taken up arms en masse to join the VNH's calls for organised action against what they have labelled a systematic attempt to bring revolution to the Netherlands.\n\nThe results of this hostile rhetoric have been riots across the nation targeting known socialists as well as several leftist institutions. There have even been reports of Landwacht-backed attempts to break into the SDAP party headquarters hoping to take control over membership records. Some have suggested this was done to assist nationwide attacks on everything leftwards of the VDB.\n\nWhat should our response be to this upsurge in violence?"
 holpostel.2.a: "Let the riots take place."
 holpostel.2.b: "Have the police intervene."

 holpostel.3.t: "Groningen Mutiny"
 holpostel.3.d: "The northern part of the Netherlands has always been an unashamedly red bastion, a view that has unfortunately been reinforced today as a mutiny on a small military vessel near the island of Schiermonnikoog resulted in disaster.\n\nThe left-wing mutineers sailed to Groningen, where they rallied elements of the local populace and took over a military armoury. Within hours more forces stationed in the area had joined the revolt. Soon after this David Wijnkoop appeared on the radio through a hijacked radio station declaring that hatred towards the left 'is institutionalised' and that the Binnenhof Fire was a signal for a new revolution.\n\nWhen the national government tried to direct the military to put down the revolt it appeared a good part of the armed forces, even in the rest of the country, mutinied in favour of the reds. A syndicalist takeover now seems inevitable!"
 holpostel.3.a: "Lang leve de revolutie!"
 holpostel.3.b: "We'll put down the revolt."

 holpostel.6.t: "Seizure of the Dutch colonies in the West?!"
 holpostel.6.d: "After the socialist tide reached the Netherlands, concerns have risen about the allegiance of Dutch Guyana and the Caribbean islands still under the Dutch flag. While it is possible that a Dutch government in exile will rise to claim them, perhaps it would be best for us to move in as soon as possible, lest a hostile power move in and use it as a base of operations in the western hemisphere."
 holpostel.6.a: "It is in their best interests too."
 holpostel.6.b: "We are stretched thin as it is!"

 holpostel.7.t: "West Indies Federation Requests West-Indian Mandate"
 holpostel.7.d: "The West Indies Federation has proposed that they protect our colonial possessions in the western hemisphere until we recover the Dutch mainland, arguing that they are currently vulnerable to both hostile conquest from syndicalists as well as opportunistic South American nations."
 holpostel.7.a: "Fair reasoning."
 holpostel.7.b: "We can defend our possessions ourselves."

 holpostel.8.t: "Dutch Accept the Offer"
 holpostel.8.d: "The Dutch government-in-exile has accepted our offer to protect their American possessions from outside threats, and has handed over the colonies of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, as well as Suriname."
 holpostel.8.a: "Excellent news."

 holpostel.9.t: "Dutch Refuse our Offer"
 holpostel.9.d: "The Dutch government-in-exile has refused our offer to protect their American possessions from outside threats."
 holpostel.9.a: "It was worth a shot."

 holpostel.10.t: "Landwacht Recruitment"
 holpostel.10.d: "Following our crackdown on riots and marches targeting left-wing targets, the Landwacht has not only taken over much of the rioting in a much more organised way, but they are also recruiting new members at local police stations among those arrested.\n\nIf we allow this practice to continue we risk having to deal with a very large number of Landwacht in the future, radicalised by their time in the cells, street combat with leftists and a sense of political persecution."
 holpostel.10.a: "Let them recruit."
 holpostel.10.b: "Change our policies now!"

 holpostel.11.t: "Landwacht and Red Front Gather in Friesland"
 holpostel.11.d: "Now that the Landwacht has attracted a large number of new members, it seems that a number of local branches are coming together at the border of Friesland. At the same time, we have been observing Red Front stragglers digging in inside the city of Leeuwarden.\n\nTheir huge numerical superiority makes it apparent that the Landwacht will crush the Red Front for years to come if we let them fight each other but letting them do so will not only put us at a risk of having to deal with a virtually unopposed paramilitary organisation, but it will probably also result in a massacre!"
 holpostel.11.a: "Let the extremists kill each other."
 holpostel.11.b: "Have the military contain both parties."

 holpostel.12.t: "Leftists in Exile"
 holpostel.12.d: "Following the decimation of the remnants of the Red Front at the so-called 'Battle of Leeuwarden', many left-wing elements across the country have seemingly decided that the Netherlands is no longer safe and as a result a stream of refugees has been leaving for Communard France in recent weeks. This will surely have a negative impact on left-wing electoral results in the future as well as on their dreams of revolution."
 holpostel.12.a: "Good riddance!"

 holpostel.13.t: "Finsterwolde Conspiracy"
 holpostel.13.d: "Deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken of the VNH called a nationwide party assembly in Maastricht. During the assembly, he gave a speech denouncing our government as secretly being ruled by syndicalists. The press had previously mockingly dubbed this conspiracy theory the 'Finsterwolde conspiracy' after the sole municipality in the Netherlands that has the RSAP as the majority in its municipal council.\n\nConspiracy theory or not, an open revolt was declared against our government, with members of the VNH proclaiming that the rebels sought to end enduring syndicalist influence over the Dutch state for good. This message appears to have been effective at resonating with the population, or at least with VNH supporters, many of whom appeared to be more than happy to join the revolt.\n\nWhile initially sympathetic to the government, which had sought to block the revolt by using a broadcast by the Queen, the VNH's more moderate leadership decided to switch sides in favour of the rebellion, and a populist takeover seems almost inevitable."
 holpostel.13.a: "The cryptosyndicalists flee the country!"
 holpostel.13.b: "We shall put down the revolt."

 holpostel.15.t: "Police Join Anti-Syndicalist Riots"
 holpostel.15.d: "Following our lack of action against anti-syndicalist riots, there have not only been reports of the riots growing in size, but it appears that in multiple cities, local law enforcement have in fact joined the raving mobs in attacking socialists. In some cases, the socialists are the ones arrested, in others, local law enforcement have used their weapons against them, instead of to defend them. Socialist elements, especially the more moderate ones, are crying out for the government to do something to alleviate the suffering they have been going through ever since the Binnenhof was burned to the ground."
 holpostel.15.a: "The police ought to be neutral!"
 holpostel.15.b: "They have no one to blame but themselves."

 holpostel.16.t: "Formation of the Dorpswacht"
 holpostel.16.d: "Following our orders to the national police to abstain from attacking left-wing civilians and institutions without proper reason, the VNH has announced the formation of the Dorpswacht. Unlike the Landwacht it is not a nationwide institution, but more of a weaponised neighbourhood watch, taking up extrajudicial policing duties as well as organising raids on the properties of alleged syndicalists and marching along the most important streets.\n\nMore Dorpswacht organisations are springing up across the country, and it appears that many moderate rightists view the Dorpswacht as a more acceptable alternative to the Landwacht, who are frequently seen as overly aggressive."
 holpostel.16.a: "Shut every single one of them down."
 holpostel.16.b: "Allow them to operate."

 holpostel.17.t: "Dorpswachters Flock to Landwacht"
 holpostel.17.d: "People who once considered the Landwacht little more than paranoid radicals are, as a result of our crackdown on the local Dorpswacht, flocking towards the regular Landwacht. This is because these radicalised former moderates feel that the government is failing to protect them from radical leftists intending to kill them."
 holpostel.17.a: "This might be a problem."
 holpostel.17.b: "Sabotage Landwacht recruitment processes."

 holpostel.18.t: "Landwacht Camp Scandal"
 holpostel.18.d: "With Dorpswachten springing up all across the country, it soon became clear that the people seized by these organisations were not being handed over to the legally recognised police. This has prompted the 'Centrale Inlichtingendienst', the Dutch central intelligence service, to start an investigation on where these people actually vanished to.\n\nInvestigators have discovered that leftists apprehended by the Dorpswachten across the Netherlands are typically handed over to provincial camps run by the Landwacht, where they being held under tight control. Unsurprisingly, this is legally considered kidnapping."
 holpostel.18.a: "This is fine."
 holpostel.18.b: "Shut these damn camps down!"

 holpostel.19.t: "March on the Hague"
 holpostel.19.d: "A number of people have increasingly viewed our government as too soft on the forces of extremism tearing the Netherlands apart. On the other hand, the VNH and its use of extrajudicial measures against the syndicalists have gained it great support amongst the population.\n\nNow the Landwacht, which has gained a great deal of influence in past months, has come together in Amsterdam to march to the Hague on foot.\n\nThe Queen, seeing that the Landwacht has now grown so strong and so influential within the military, has recognised that resisting what clearly represents a coup would be futile. Therefore, Wilhelmina has dismissed our government in favour of a new VNH cabinet led by Swart that plans on ruling the country like a dictatorship."
 holpostel.19.a: "Perhaps we were too soft."

 holpostel.20.t: "Rising Crime Levels"
 holpostel.20.d: "As the recession continues, more and more unemployed Dutchmen are turning to crime as a last resort to support themselves and their family.\n\nThe result is that the paramilitary Landwacht and Red Front are getting a policing role in those areas where they reign supreme and the police is unable to keep this trend in check. This is in turn leading to growing sympathy amongst the population towards the political movements behind these organisations.\n\nIf we are to avoid membership of more extreme political ideologies growing, then we must stop this, though that will probably not be a popular measure."
 holpostel.20.a: "Prohibit paramilitaries from policing."
 holpostel.20.b: "Let them do their thing."

 holpostel.21.t: "The Scourge of Alcoholism"
 holpostel.21.d: "As general living standard continues to decline, there is a disturbing trend of people resorting to the bottle in order to forget their problems.\n\nThe economy will recover at some point, with or without government intervention, but if alcoholism becomes too serious an issue it might affect our productivity even after the crisis. As a result, many are advocating the prohibition of sales of alcoholic beverages. Still others, say this goes against the freedom of the individual."
 holpostel.21.a: "Cheers to the prohibition."
 holpostel.21.b: "Making my dear whiskey illegal? No way."

 holpostel.22.t: "Alcohol Crime Cartels"
 holpostel.22.d: "Not so long ago, the only parties that kept our streets unsafe were political in nature, but since we have started to prohibit the sale of alcoholic drinks, several criminal cartels involved in smuggling or producing liquor have sprung up. What is worse, they are fighting each other for the sole right to sell liquor in certain areas. The police are far from capable of keeping this in check and as a result the Red Front and Landwacht have started to supplant them in keeping the streets safe. Either we rescind the prohibition and give in to criminals, or we keep things as they are, probably resulting in the extreme left and right taking credit for containing the cartels."
 holpostel.22.a: "Abandon the prohibition."
 holpostel.22.b: "Keep the prohibition."

 holpostel.23.t: "'Labourers Don't Drink Beer!'"
 holpostel.23.d: "'Arbeiders drinken geen bier' is the name of the syndicalist campaign to fight alcoholism in the working class, seeing it as method by which the reactionaries and capitalists keep the proletariat crushed underfoot. As alcoholism became a growing problem in the Netherlands, and with the governments unwillingness to act on it, independent conservative movements pursuing the same goal started to work together with the syndicalists, resulting in growing sympathy for both ideologies and increasing political polarisation."
 holpostel.23.a: "Encourage private actions against alcoholism..."
 holpostel.23.b: "... but not when syndicalism is involved!"

 holpostel.24.t: "Populist Welfare"
 holpostel.24.d: "Since the beginning of the crisis many sections of our welfare system have deteriorated, and the country is filled with unemployed people who can hardly obtain the food required to support their families. As a result, the VNH has started a nationwide campaign distributing food to these areas and opening food banks and soup kitchens. These actions have created a lot of goodwill towards them and makes it look like, even though they are currently not in power, they are the ones who care for the people.\n\nWe could shut their project down, but risk inciting a great deal of anger amongst the working classes."
 holpostel.24.a: "It's good for the people."
 holpostel.24.b: "Shut it down."

 holpostel.25.t: "NAS Overtakes NVV"
 holpostel.25.d: "The NVV, the most important social democratic union within the Netherlands for years, has, according to the latest CBS report, been overtaken by the syndicalist NAS in terms of membership.\n\nThis is a bad sign for the SDAP, as it sends a loud signal that their power base is quickly leaking away to the more radical side of Dutch politics. It also provides evidence that their pillar, so far untouched by the ongoing process of depillarisation, is now undergoing the same crumbling that the other pillars have felt. The NAS becoming the most important trade union in the country has the potential to be very dangerous, therefore some voices in our government have called for an official announcement that we will not countenance any negotiations with the NAS, hopefully limiting its appeal."
 holpostel.25.a: "We do not negotiate with syndicalists."
 holpostel.25.b: "We accept the new status quo."

 holpostel.26.t: "Malieveld Protests"
 holpostel.26.d: "A huge rally of radical socialists, syndicalists and other left-wing fringe movements has started on the Malieveld in The Hague.\n\nThey are protesting against what they call the rule of the capitalists and some even openly call for a revolution. The local police is wondering what they should be doing - should they crack down on the demonstration or let it run its course?"
 holpostel.26.a: "Let the rally proceed."
 holpostel.26.b: "Shut that red scum gathering down."

 holpostel.27.t: "February Strike"
 holpostel.27.d: "This morning, the trams stood still in Amsterdam. At the same time, RSAP and NAS followers were spreading the manifesto 'Staakt, staakt, staakt!' - Strike, strike, strike! among Amsterdam companies. By noon, it had become a general strike and by the evening it has spread to all nearby cities, including Haarlem, Hilversum and Utrecht. This syndicalist-organised strike is quickly becoming the largest strike the Netherlands has ever seen.\n\nAn emergency meeting is taking place in The Hague and three options are being considered: accept the demands, which is the preferred approach of the left, wait the strike out, regardless of the potential harm to the economy, or break the strike up, the preferred option of the right."
 holpostel.27.a: "Give the Syndies their win."
 holpostel.27.b: "They will give up in time."
 holpostel.27.c: "Drive them back to where they belong!"

 holpostel.28.t: "February Strike Continues"
 holpostel.28.d: "Our waiting strategy does not seem to be working so far, it has only emboldened the strikers, who have now been holding out for a whopping three months. Meanwhile, our economy remains largely still, and many who were earlier in favour of waiting the strike out are now advocating giving in to their demands. Unfortunately, the respect the syndicalists have gained during these days will only grow if we are to back down now."
 holpostel.28.a: "Raise the white flag."
 holpostel.28.b: "Time is on our side."
 holpostel.28.c: "Break it up, it's been long enough!"

 holpostel.29.t: "Strikers Return to Work"
 holpostel.29.d: "After five months of continuous striking, it appears that finally the strikers are giving up. More and more workers have been returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, where they should be, and today the NAS has called off the strike without having gained any concessions.\n\nThis is a serious political blow to the radical left, who have been humiliated and no longer seen as being able to press their will. On top of that their monetary resources expended to maintain the strikers has depleted massively. Still, we ought to be careful, because we've won a battle, not the war."
 holpostel.29.a: "Take that, red scum."

 holpostel.30.t: "Radio Rood"
 holpostel.30.d: "Founded by a group of Dutch syndicalist exiles, Radio Rood is a London-based radio station slandering 'the Dutch capitalist dictatorship' and calling for acts of resistance 'against the bourgeois pigs occupying our country'.\n\nThey are spreading lies about certain events happening here as well as making up events of their own and claiming that the legitimate media is ignoring these fact to keep the proletariat dumb. The problem is that there is a significant portion of our population who actually believes this rubbish, and we have little to no way to shut down a radio station based in a country our relations are hostile with, to say the least."
 holpostel.30.a: "Confiscate every civilian radio!"
 holpostel.30.b: "They don't harm anyone."

 holpostel.31.t: "French Arms Smugglers Captured"
 holpostel.31.d: "We have captured a group of French nationals carrying explosives across the Flemish-Walloon-Dutch border.\n\nThey won't explain their presence, nor the source of their explosives, and after a search the name of a prominent local syndicalist and a location was discovered in one of the men's pockets. Police arriving at the designated location did not find anyone present despite a prolonged search. According to the law, the smugglers will be designated 'unwanted foreigners' and evicted, but the Central Intelligence Service wants to interrogate the men; they might be affiliated with the Communard government which would make this an act of espionage."
 holpostel.31.a: "Let the GS III interrogate the foreigners."
 holpostel.31.b: "Just evict them!"

 holpostel.32.t: "French Nationals Confess"
 holpostel.32.d: "The French nationals we apprehended at the border a few days ago came clean with their plans to the GS III after the interrogation: apparently they sought to supply explosives to a local Sorelian-affiliated group in order to blow up the Amsterdam Centraal Station, the heart of our nation's train infrastructure, in an operation that is at least not directly attributable to the Communard government.\n\nThey have given up their contacts within our country and the police are ready to shut down every foreign Vanguardist terrorist cell residing within our country."
 holpostel.32.a: "Roll them up and evict the French."

 holpostel.33.t: "French Nationals Stay Silent"
 holpostel.33.d: "Despite a prolonged interrogation, the GS III has been unable to extract any meaningful information from the French nationals we captured at the border. They are now asking for explicit government sanction to use physical... arguments to convince them to speak. This would, strictly speaking, be unconstitutional, but they are syndicalist foreigners after all."
 holpostel.33.a: "Permission granted."
 holpostel.33.b: "No, just throw them out."

 holpostel.34.t: "French Nationals Remain Silent"
 holpostel.34.d: "Despite the extra rights granted to the GS III in this case, the mysterious French nationals still do not seem willing to talk. Continuing the torture might now result in their death however, so the GS III once again has sought orders from the government as to what they are supposed to do..."
 holpostel.34.a: "We'll keep going until they speak or die!"
 holpostel.34.b: "It's not worth the effort."

 holpostel.35.t: "French Nationals Die"
 holpostel.35.d: "After a prolonged interrogation, that became very emotional for a while, one by one the French nationals somehow ended up dead. Obviously, it was purely accidental and of course we had nothing to do with it as we would never violate the constitution by torturing these people. Still, the fact remains that we still do not know what they were planning with those explosives, but at least the world is better off with seven syndicalists removed from it."
 holpostel.35.a: "Put the designer of the interrogation room on trial for manslaughter!"

 holpostel.36.t: "Centraal Station Bombing"
 holpostel.36.d: "The Amsterdam Central Station, the heart of rail infrastructure in our country, has today been blown up resulting in 127 deaths. Responsibility was claimed by a small syndicalist group affiliated with the Communard Sorelian faction in France.\n\nAfter investigation of the debris, it appears that the explosives used are the same as those confiscated from a group of French nationals that were smuggling them. It appears that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided."
 holpostel.36.a: "Verdomde Syndies!"

 holpostel.37.t: "Torture Story Leaks!"
 holpostel.37.d: "How it has ended up the hands of the press no-one knows, but the fact is that they somehow acquired a copy of the document sanctioning the GS III to torture the French nationals we arrested at the border not so long ago.\n\nThis will only strengthen the syndicalists in their rhetoric that the Dutch government is in fact a banana republic that is violating its own constitution. They will inevitably state that we are not even close to the democracy we portray ourselves as and that the Dutch regime will need to be replaced with a syndicalist model."
 holpostel.37.a: "Aargh."

 holpostel.38.t: "Revolutionary Statue Vandalised!"
 holpostel.38.d: "A statue in Rotterdam erected in honour of the revolution has been besmirched in orange, white and blue by a filthy reactionary. Sadly, the response is that more and more young people, who admire the courage of the deed, have been inspired to follow the anti-revolutionary underground VNH, who are plotting to take down the fragile nation we have just established. If we are to prevent a growth of this form of underground resistance, we must crack down hard on this!"
 holpostel.38.a: "Crack down on all anti-revolutionaries in Rotterdam!"
 holpostel.38.b: "Just wash it off!"

 holpostel.39.t: "Assassination in Utrecht"
 holpostel.39.d: "Johan Albarda drove through Utrecht today on his way for a public event. He was accompanied by the minister of interior, Wilem Drees as he went.\n\nA lone gunman, a member of the VNH, decided to take aim for Albarda. Sadly for him though, Drees and Albarda wear similar suits, and from his location the gunman is unable to recognise who is who his target is; he must take a guess. Which man should he shoot?"
 holpostel.39.a: "The man on the left."
 holpostel.39.b: "The man on the right."

 holpostel.40.t: "Assassin Arrested"
 holpostel.40.d: "The police are reported to have arrested the lone gunman responsible for the assassination. He goes by the name of Peter Ton and appears to be an active member of the VNH, as well as fiercely opposed to everything affiliated with socialism. For now, he's being held at the prison in Vught."
 holpostel.40.a: "Good!"

 holpostel.41.t: "Vught Prison Siege"
 holpostel.41.d: "A huge crowd gathered today in Vught, demanding the prison hand over Peter Ton to them. It didn't take long for the pressure to build leading to the prison kommandant giving Ton up, resulting in him being lynched on the spot by the furious crowd. In the throes of victory, the mob have started to demand that the prison releases syndicalists imprisoned there and deliver other right-wingers to them, presumably to do the same to them!"
 holpostel.41.a: "Intervene fast!"
 holpostel.41.b: "They asked for it!"

 holpostel.42.t: "Anti-Rightist Riots Cease"
 holpostel.42.d: "Following public speeches by several social democratic politicians, the mobs targeting right-wing figures and groups around the country, undoubtedly stirred up by the syndicalists, have started to disperse."
 holpostel.42.a: "We survived one more crisis."

 holpostel.43.t: "Amerikagangers"
 holpostel.43.d: "Amerikagangers or 'America-goers' are Dutch syndicalists that have assembled in large groups to prepare to fight as volunteers with the Combined Syndicates in the American Civil War. Their preparations are almost complete which poses a problem for our government as to how to approach them. If we let them leave it could jeopardise potential future relations with whichever non-syndicalist power is victorious in America.\n\nWithin the government, most people are advocating forfeiture of citizenship if they join the syndicalist army, as per the law; some say the Dutch expression 'prevention is better than to cure' applies here, and then there are some who think we should just let them spend their holiday in America."
 holpostel.43.a: "Confiscate their passports."
 holpostel.43.b: "Warn them they will lose their citizenship."
 holpostel.43.c: "Just let them go."

 holpostel.44.t: "Dutch Volunteers Arrive"
 holpostel.44.d: "Dutch volunteers have arrived to help the syndicalist cause; they are not very well trained however and their division is rather small, so we may need to invest in them in order to make them a significant fighting force or just throw them at the enemy, which will probably result in high casualties."
 holpostel.44.a: "We need all help we can get!"

 holpostel.45.t: "Annual VNH Landdag"
 holpostel.45.d: "The annual VNH landdag will start in a week in Utrecht, the first one since the 1937 elections. The GS III, the Dutch secret service, has found out that they will be announcing a major policy change for coming year and they themselves seem rather certain that this will result in a boost of support for their movement, reinforced by the fact that the VNH is encouraging non-members to come as well. The GS III has sadly not been able to retrieve information about the said policy change.\n\nSome are saying that the ideology of the VNH is dangerous and that it would be best if we stop the landdag from occurring at all, possibly through revoking their permit to hold a rally; others say this gathering is protected by freedom of speech and should just go ahead."
 holpostel.45.a: "The landdag may go ahead."
 holpostel.45.b: "Revoke their permit."

 holpostel.46.t: "VNH National Landdag 1937"
 holpostel.46.d: "As expected the VNH national landdag in the Utrechtse Jaarbeurs went ahead today. First VNH leader Swart held a little inspiring cliché-speech about how much the movement had grown since he joined, but the truly interesting part came after that. Deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming the VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while also curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH."
 holpostel.46.a: "I'm glad it's over."

 holpostel.47.t: "VNH Landdag in Nijmegen?"
 holpostel.47.d: "After their permit for a rally in Utrecht was revoked, the VNH leadership has now asked the municipality of Nijmegen to allow a rally in the open air. Nijmegen is much more remote than Utrecht, and so it will probably attract far fewer visitors."
 holpostel.47.a: "Alright then!"
 holpostel.47.b: "No, thank you."

 holpostel.48.t: "VNH National Landdag 1937"
 holpostel.48.d: "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the VNH national landdag went ahead in Nijmegen today. First VNH leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning the municipal authorities in Utrecht for revoking the permit to rally in the jaarbeurs there. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH, although the new location of the landdag is probably less ideal for attracting new members."
 holpostel.48.a: "I'm glad it's over."

 holpostel.49.t: "VNH Landdag in Antwerpen?"
 holpostel.49.d: "The Dutch far-right party VNH is requesting the right to hold a rally in Antwerpen. Apparently their permit to hold a rally was revoked in the Netherlands itself and attempts to choose a different location or time also failed, with the help of their hostile government. Now they are asking us if they may hold the landdag in Antwerpen, outside the authority of the Dutch government, so that they can in fact hold their landdag."
 holpostel.49.a: "Flanders-Wallonia welcomes you!"
 holpostel.49.b: "Surely their permit was revoked for a reason!"

 holpostel.50.t: "VNH National Landdag 1937"
 holpostel.50.d: "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the VNH national landdag went ahead in Antwerpen today. First VNH leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning us for trying to stop their landdag. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH, although most would-be new members probably won't like having to go to Flanders-Wallonia to attend the rally."
 holpostel.50.a: "I'm glad it's over."

 holpostel.51.t: "VNH National Landdag Cancelled"
 holpostel.51.d: "Following the failure to find a location to hold the landdag, the VNH leadership has declared the cancellation of the annual landdag of 1937 and condemned us for being the primary cause for it. They also said that they won't let themselves be muzzled and that the landdag of 1938 will be held properly prepared to deal with another so-called cowardly attempt by the government to stop them."
 holpostel.51.a: "Take that, populists!"

 holpostel.52.t: "VNH Demonstration during Prinsjesdag"
 holpostel.52.d: "Prinsjesdag is the day the Dutch government publicises its plans for spending for the next year: the Queen will read out the annual plans of the government and it is usually a festive affair, however this year the VNH has started a demonstration along the road where the Queen will pass, flying their black flags, beating up alleged syndicalists and using their party greeting 'houzee' towards Cornelis van Geelkerken, deputy leader of the VNH, who is present. The mayor of The Hague wants to let the police break up the demonstration as he fears it would pose a threat to public order and the safety of the royal family. On the other hand, the VNH-opposition in the municipal council of The Hague says this is an essential part of freedom of speech and asserts that the VNH will not attack the Royal family."
 holpostel.52.a: "Remove them."
 holpostel.52.b: "Let them hold their silly little protest."

 holpostel.53.t: "Nationaal Herstel Expands"
 holpostel.53.d: "The far-right newspaper 'Nationaal Herstel', closely affiliated with the VNH, has recruited two high-profile reporters today. Some consider this a threat as it will likely broaden the appeal of the newspaper that spreads unconventional ideas and is in fact a propaganda tool for the VNH and the far right in general. Purely legally speaking however, there is no real basis to ban the paper, as it would be both contrary to freedom of the press and freedom of speech, two values that normally are respected within our country."
 holpostel.53.a: "Just ban it already."
 holpostel.53.b: "Leave them alone."

 holpostel.54.t: "Landwacht Breaks Strike"
 holpostel.54.d: "The Landwacht has broken a local strike today, resulting in an excellent photo-opportunity with the company's employers stemming from the Landwacht's, and by extension the VNH's, willingness to act where the government didn't want to do so. Some are calling for a response against this action saying that the strike was justified, that the government didn't put it down for a reason and that the Landwacht had no right to do it in the government's place."
 holpostel.54.a: "Sanctions will be in order."
 holpostel.54.b: "It's only good when strikes are broken."

 holpostel.55.t: "Landwacht and Red Front clash"
 holpostel.55.d: "The Landwacht and the National Red Front are clashing today in Haarlem, resulting in a large riot, many casualties as well as large damage to public and private property. The police are ready to intervene, but in governmental circles there is uncertainty as to who should be targeted. Some say that the Red Front counterdemonstration was a direct attack on the pro-VNH demonstrators, so only Red Front members should be arrested. Others however say that the VNHers should not have immediately picked a fight with their long sticks when they spotted the Red Front counter-movement."
 holpostel.55.a: "Only arrest syndicalists."
 holpostel.55.b: "Objectively arrest everyone who caused trouble."
 holpostel.55.c: "Only arrest populists."

 holpostel.56.t: "Nationale Jeugdstorm"
 holpostel.56.d: "The VNH has today announced the founding of the nationale jeugdstorm. It is in effect a scouting organisation, but it appears to be seen by VNH leadership as a way to expand on the growing appeal the VNH has on the younger generation and to set up an ideological base among those that are at this point in time too young to vote but who will attain that age within the coming years."
 holpostel.56.a: "Dangerous, ban the institution!"
 holpostel.56.b: "An initiative that only should be applauded!"

 holpostel.57.t: "Military voices support for the VNH"
 holpostel.57.d: "Several high ranking officers have today publicly voiced their support for the VNH, in particular the more moderate part represented by Henri Swart. They released a manifesto detailing their reasoning behind this move that details how they feel misrepresented by the democratic government and how the government is unwilling to truly serve Dutch interests. This is a sign that VNH support may be greater than previously expected. While these are only officers it is probable that this sentiment is present amongst the common soldiery as well, and so some officials have proposed measures to limit VNH presence in the military."
 holpostel.57.a: "Institute those measures."
 holpostel.57.b: "The military has always been a nationalist institution."

 holpostel.60.t: "CNA Schism"
 holpostel.60.d: "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New NRKSP, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the CNA quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the CNA the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nWhile a number of Protestant denominations and several important loyalist Catholics have announced that they will continue the CNA project, it is clear that the CNA has lost her already marginal absolute majority, and without it we will need to compromise with opposition parties per-issue."
 holpostel.60.a: "Maybe it was too good to be true from the start."

 holpostel.61.t: "Elections of 1938"
 holpostel.61.d: "As a result, of the schism in the CNA, elections are being held barely a year after the last elections. A harsh three months of campaigning are now behind us and it is time to count the votes; this will clearly be a referendum on CNA leadership; on whether Catholics will abandon them in favour of the NRKSP, and whether the CNA base will still hold this time."
 holpostel.61.a: "The RSAP sweeps the elections."
 holpostel.61.b: "The SDAP becomes the largest party."
 holpostel.61.c: "The CNA loses but remains the largest party."
 holpostel.61.e: "The CNA base defects to the VNH."

 holpostel.62.t: "SDAP Forms New Government"
 holpostel.62.d: "The SDAP has become the largest party in the elections. After days of celebration, it will soon be time to form a new government. We do not have an absolute majority like the CNA had last year, so we will have to form our cabinet with other parties and act as part of a coalition. Time is short however, as the humbled CNA is seeking to negotiate with a wide range of figures to create a reactionary front against us."
 holpostel.62.a: "A purple cabinet with the LSP and VDB."
 holpostel.62.b: "A Roman-Red cabinet with the NRKSP."
 holpostel.62.c: "A centre-left cabinet with the RSAP and VDB."
 holpostel.62.e: "The CNA assembles a rainbow cabinet to oppose us."

 holpostel.63.t: "Wilhelmina's Demands"
 holpostel.63.d: "Queen Wilhelmina is only willing to allow this coalition to form if the more moderate VDB get the prime minister post. This would reduce us to a junior partner despite us being the largest party in the coalition."
 holpostel.63.a: "Accept the demands."
 holpostel.63.b: "She'll just have to deal with our success."

 holpostel.64.t: "Wilhelmina Abdicates"
 holpostel.64.d: "Following our unwillingness to cave in to her demands, the Queen has decided that she will not be Queen in an SDAP-ruled country, and as such she has decided to abdicate. We can allow Princess Juliana to be crowned, but the RSAP and the more radical side of the SDAP are clamouring to exploit this opportunity to institute a republic while we still have momentum on our side. The moderates in the SDAP and the VDB favour Juliana however."
 holpostel.64.a: "Long live the Republic!"
 holpostel.64.b: "Long live Queen Juliana!"

 holpostel.65.t: "CNA Forms New Government"
 holpostel.65.d: "Despite the treachery of the Catholics, we once again became the largest party in parliament. Contrary to last year however, we do not have an absolute majority meaning that we will need to compromise with some people to form a new government."
 holpostel.65.a: "Staphorster variant: With the LSP, NRKSP and SGP parliamentary support."
 holpostel.65.b: "A right-wing government with the VNH."
 holpostel.65.c: "A centre-right government with the LSP, NRKSP and VDB."

 holpostel.66.t: "CNA Schism"
 holpostel.66.d: "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New NRKSP, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the CNA quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the CNA the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nLuckily, many Protestants of multiple denominations as well as several high ranking Catholics have expressed their support for continuing the CNA, meaning that the cabinet can, thanks to our coalition with others, continue to rule."
 holpostel.66.a: "It could have been worse."

 holpostel.67.t: "CNA Collapses"
 holpostel.67.d: "The CNA electoral pact was originally created to win victory in the 1937 elections, and once it failed in that goal its continued survival became increasingly precarious. Today matters came to a head as the Catholics announced their withdrawal from the pact and determination to refound their RKSP party. Shortly thereafter, former CHU members announced that they too would leave the unstable union and thus, with no alliance anymore, the ARP has returned as well. So much for united confessional politics."
 holpostel.67.a: "Conservative politics is splintered again."

 holpostel.68.t: "Formation of the Labour Party"
 holpostel.68.d: "After the 1937 victory through their 'Lijst Links', the SDAP and VDB started flirting with the idea of permanently uniting the parties into one 'Party of Labour' or 'Partij van de Arbeid' in Dutch.\n\nBy late 1941, after almost completing a successful term of coalition rule in governing the country, both the annual landdag of the SDAP and that of the VDB elected to dissolve partisan differences and found this party, with the former doing it very quietly to avoid angering more leftist members. This has resulted in the creation of a progressive juggernaut that could be a dominant force in Dutch politics for the rest of the century."
 holpostel.68.a: "We're the PvdA now!"

 holpostel.69.t: "Committee Oud"
 holpostel.69.d: "While for the SDAP the merger was far less painless, there was certainly a lot more friction caused within the VDB. At first the right-wing of the VDB saw it out, but now after two months the current prime minister Oud has formed 'Committee Oud' with other former VDB members who feel that the PvdA has been kowtowing far too much towards social democratic views. Committee Oud has successfully negotiated a merger with the market liberal LSP, to form a more conservative liberal party that could also be a force to be reckoned with in post-Weltkrieg Dutch politics. All that is left is how the party should be named."
 holpostel.69.a: "Partij van de Vrijheid, or 'Freedom Party'."
 holpostel.69.b: "... sounds too much like a futuristic populist party."

 holpostel.70.t: "Elections of 1941"
 holpostel.70.d: "After four years of left-wing rule, it is once again time to go to the ballot box. Contention is high, as each party seeks to take the plurality in hopes of gaining the key role in the formation: the question shall be whether the populace thinks things have improved since 1937 and who is responsible for that fact."
 holpostel.70.a: "The [hol_socdems_variable_party_name] takes an absolute majority."
 holpostel.70.b: "The [hol_socdems_variable_party_name] is the largest party but lacks a majority."
 holpostel.70.pvdv: "The PvdV is the largest party but lacks a majority."
 holpostel.70.vvd: "The VVD is the largest party but lacks a majority."
 holpostel.70.e: "The ARP, RKSP and CHU seize a key role."
 holpostel.70.f: "The VNH becomes the largest but lacks a majority."

 holpostel.71.t: "PvdA Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.71.d: "The people apparently were very happy with our progress, and having received a comfortable majority in parliament we do not even need to consider forming a coalition with other parties.\n\nOf course we cannot help but laugh a bit at Pieter Oud and his committee who would've probably led his second cabinet had he not abandoned us; now he and his liberals are banished to the opposition, like all other non-PvdA parties."
 holpostel.71.a: "What does he have now? Nine seats?"

 holpostel.72.t: "PvdA Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.72.d: "We have won the elections, and while it is clearly not enough to attain an absolute majority and to rule by ourselves, it is still more than enough for us to get the initiative in the formation. Several options are available, and it is up to us to decide who we'd prefer as our new partner"
 holpostel.72.a: "Purple with the PvdV."
 holpostel.72.b: "Purple with the VV.D."
 holpostel.72.c: "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
 holpostel.72.e: "Bright Red with the RSAP."

 holpostel.73.t.pvdv: "PvdV Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.73.t.vvd: "VVD Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.73.d: "Prime minister Oud managed to make excellent use of the premiersbonus, and coupled with a series of fresh liberal policies, we have managed to attract the most votes compared to all other parties in the Netherlands in our first general election. While obviously not enough seats were won to rule the country by ourselves, we have won the initiative in the formation negotiations, and so we may see who we'd like best as our partner."
 holpostel.73.a: "Purple with the PvdA."
 holpostel.73.b: "Conservative Liberalism with the CHU and Catholics."
 holpostel.73.c: "Stikkercoalitie: ARP with VNH outside support."

 holpostel.74.t: "Conservatives Form 1941 Government"
 holpostel.74.d: "Even though the CNA project failed, we still managed to attract the most votes when combined. This means that we are in a good position to influence the formation, probably with the ability to have at least one of our parties deliver the prime minister. We'll just need to wait out the proposals of the other parties."
 holpostel.74.a: "CHU rules with Oud's liberals, the RKSP and ARP."
 holpostel.74.b: "ARP rules with Oud's liberals and Drees' Social Democrats."
 holpostel.74.c: "CHU rules with the PvdA, RKSP and ARP."
 holpostel.74.e: "ARP rules with the VNH, CHU and RKSP."

 holpostel.75.t: "Progressives Flock to the LSP"
 holpostel.75.d: "Following the government-induced red scare, every left-wing organisation politically left of the LSP has been discredited and has since either disbanded or been banned. As a result, progressives instead flocked towards the conservative-liberal LSP, which was seen as 'the least bad' resulting in both a subtle yet decisive shift to the left yet also and a breath of life into a party that had been in an impasse since the first Weltkrieg."
 holpostel.75.a: "Fascinating."

 holpostel.76.t: "Elections of 1941"
 holpostel.76.d: "Colijn has done it again: completing yet another term with the cabinet he formed in 1937. Now it is once again election time, and the question on everyone's mind in The Hague right now is whether the people feel he has used his time well or whether a different approach is in order."
 holpostel.76.a: "Colijn takes once again an absolute majority."
 holpostel.76.b: "CNA becomes the largest but without a majority."
 holpostel.76.c: "LSP becomes the largest but without a majority."
 holpostel.76.e: "SDAP becomes the largest but without a majority."
 holpostel.76.f: "VNH becomes the largest but without a majority."
 holpostel.76.g: "RSAP becomes the largest but without a majority."

 holpostel.77.t: "CNA Forms 1941 Government with Increased Majority"
 holpostel.77.d: "Beyond all of our greatest hopes, our party managed to seize more than fifty seats in parliament. Colijn has announced that he will retire, and Louis Beel will form the next government and he has a comfortable majority at hand in parliament to push through his policies."
 holpostel.77.a: "Continue working with the liberals."
 holpostel.77.b: "So we rule one!"

 holpostel.78.t: "CNA Forms 1941 Government with Reduced Majority"
 holpostel.78.d: "While we have been unable to secure the absolute majority like in 1937, we're still the largest party in parliament by a noticeable margin. As such, we get the initiative in the formation of a new government, which will be the first task of Louis Beel as the new leader of the CNA after Colijn's retirement."
 holpostel.78.a: "The LSP represents a reliable partner."
 holpostel.78.b: "The SDAP is less radical and therefore viable now."
 holpostel.78.c: "The VNH agrees with us on key points."

 holpostel.79.t: "LSP Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.79.d: "After the red scare, it was obvious that we were on the receiving end of a lot of former left-wingers - as could be seen during this year's annual party congress, where a lot of left-wing policies were chosen by a group of new members. It apparently did boost our party, however. With the progressive Dutch population pulling their electoral weight with us we went, within a single term, from a party close to falling below the minimum voting threshold to the largest party in parliament."
 holpostel.79.a: "Now we shall govern with the CNA."
 holpostel.79.b: "Now we shall govern with the VNH."

 holpostel.80.t: "SDAP Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.80.d: "After posing as more moderate electoral force, and perhaps thanks to the fresh campaign by our new leader Willem Drees, the SDAP has managed to account the most votes and has therefore got the initiative in the formation of the new government. Rumour has it that former leader Albarda will be appointed 'informateur' on the request of the SDAP leadership."
 holpostel.80.a: "Purple with the LSP and VDB."
 holpostel.80.b: "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
 holpostel.80.c: "Deep-Red with the RSAP."

 holpostel.81.t: "Elections in 1941?"
 holpostel.81.d: "The mandate of our coalition government is about to expire and technically we should hold elections in a few months. Many within the VNH are arguing over whether we should do this: within the VNH, the stability argument is consistently raised, and many believe that elections should therefore be suspended. On the other hand, holding the elections could also strengthen the VNH's grasp on power. In the CNA, holding elections is seen as something that should be nurtured, if guided. If the elections are not suspended, the chance that they will move through fairly is still highly unlikely."
 holpostel.81.a: "Suspend the elections."
 holpostel.81.b: "Just hold the elections."

 holpostel.82.t: "Elections of 1941"
 holpostel.82.d: "After four years of Henri Swart as prime minister elections are due to be held once again, even if cynics are pointing out obviously imaginary flaws in the democratic process - some dissidents are even suggesting that the VNH has been using election fraud as a tool."
 holpostel.82.a: "The VNH takes an absolute majority."
 holpostel.82.b: "The VNH becomes the largest."

 holpostel.83.t: "VNH Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.83.d: "Though the process may have been guided to prevent the populace from making the wrong choice, we have soundly won the elections and will take over half of the seats of the house of representatives. None in the VNH is even considering taking aboard a coalition partner."
 holpostel.83.a: "The VNH rules alone, forever..."

 holpostel.84.t: "VNH Forms 1941 Government"
 holpostel.84.d: "The same results as last time have come in - interestingly popular opinion has hardly shifted in four long years. Either way, the same choice stands as last time - we can intimidate the house of representatives for the votes needed to give us emergency powers, or we could just continue cabinet Swart I with the CNA."
 holpostel.84.a: "Work with the CNA."
 holpostel.84.b: "Have the Landwacht visit the house of reps."

 holpostel.85.t: "[GetYear] Pensionary Elections"
 holpostel.85.d: "Election time has come, and every Dutchman may vote today who their council pensionary shall be. The SDAP is the only party to nominate a pensionary candidate on their own: meanwhile the liberals have nominated a candidate together and the ARP and CHU do not contend, instead urging voters to vote in the RKSP candidate instead as they know they do not stand a chance alone either way and would prefer a conservative pensionary over a progressive one."
 holpostel.85.a: "SDAP's Adriaan Gerhard."
 holpostel.85.b: "VDB's Roelof Kranenburg."
 holpostel.85.c: "LSP's Cornelis Lodewijk van der Bilt."
 holpostel.85.e: "RKSP's Carel Goseling."

 holpostel.86.t: "Nacht van de Dooie Rooie Ratten"
 holpostel.86.d: "The red filth hit us hard in the heart of our power, by burning down the Binnenhof. And they know what will come next: unless we act fast, they will band together in the north to start a revolt in the hope of wearing down our regime. Hoping to avoid such an occasion, Van Geelkerken has ordered the Landwacht to get as many reds in custody as possible before they seize an opportunity to arm themselves, leading to resistance necessitating major violence. This night will go down in Dutch history as the 'night of dead red rats' as Van Geelkerken has aptly named it."
 holpostel.86.a: "If you can't find someone, bring in their entire family!"
 holpostel.86.b: "Surely this is unnecessary..."

 holpostel.87.t: "Daniel Goulooze Arrested"
 holpostel.87.d: "Our massive round-ups have resulted, aside from the capturing of less important leftists, in the high-profile arrest of Daniel Goulooze, a senior member of the syndicalist 'National Labour Secretariat'. The Landwacht brought him to a makeshift prison camp in the politically charged ruins of the Binnenhof, the question is what we shall do with him."
 holpostel.87.a: "Move him to the actual prison in Vught."
 holpostel.87.b: "Interrogate him here!"

 holpostel.88.t: "Goulooze's Prison Convoy Was Ambushed"
 holpostel.88.d: "Syndicalist partisans have ambushed the prison convoy carrying the high-profile prisoner Goulooze. Now we may be certain that the syndicalists will revolt as they have now publicly committed a major crime which will force them to openly rebel."
 holpostel.88.a: "We should have kept him in The Hague."

 holpostel.89.t: "Harm Kolthek Located"
 holpostel.89.d: "Despite his initial resistance to the idea, some special tools convinced Goulooze to share the location of his boss, NAS-leader Harm Kolthek, with us. Apparently, he hides in a diplomatic neighbourhood in The Hague. Deputy-leader Cornelis van Geelkerken is personally accompanying the Landwachters sent to bring him in."
 holpostel.89.a: "Praise Kees for his bravery!"

 holpostel.90.t: "Dutch Syndicalist Seeks Refuge"
 holpostel.90.d: "The legislative building in the Netherlands was attacked a few days ago by a terrorist. Blaming the syndicalists for the endeavour, the Dutch authorities and their paramilitary supporters have started rounding up syndicalists all over the country. Now Harm Kolthek, the leader of the Dutch syndicalists, is being pursued by angry paramilitaries and he is requesting refuge in our embassy. There is a good chance that he will be killed if we do not assist him."
 holpostel.90.a: "We'll protect him."
 holpostel.90.b: "Leave him out in the open."

 holpostel.91.t: "Kolthek in the Mexican Embassy"
 holpostel.91.d: "After having knocked open the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just a few hundred metres from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly, the Mexican ambassador decided that Kolthek could have his refuge, which means that according to international law, we cannot get him. The Landwacht is not officially part of the Dutch government however, and so Van Geelkerken has a choice."
 holpostel.91.a: "Embassies are inviolable."
 holpostel.91.b: "We have to get Kolthek at all costs!"

 holpostel.92.t: "Kolthek Announces Revolt Support"
 holpostel.92.d: "From inside the Mexican embassy, Kolthek has announced that the reds grouping together in the north should proceed with their rebellion so that he and Daan may soon be free again. It seems that our attempt at avoiding open rebellion has failed."
 holpostel.92.a: "Thanks Mexico..."

 holpostel.93.t: "Dutch Embassy Raided!"
 holpostel.93.d: "After seeing us granting refuge to Kolthek the Dutch 'Landwacht' paramilitary organisation decided to assault our embassy. According to early reports, they completely trashed the building and multiple members of our diplomatic mission have been wounded. Shockingly they've even kidnapped our ambassador, supposedly to hand him over to the police for helping a fugitive. While at least he was released by the Dutch police immediately, this violation is completely outrageous!"
 holpostel.93.a: "48 hours to leave the country, Dutch ambassador!"

 holpostel.94.t: "Mexican Embassy Raided"
 holpostel.94.d: "The Landwacht simply assaulted the Mexican embassy upon finding out that they granted refuge to Kolthek, wounding several Mexican members of the mission in the process as well as extracting Kolthek and assuring the partial destruction of the embassy. They also, somewhat scandalously, handed the Mexican ambassador over to the police, claiming he 'was helping a fugitive'. We have released him at once, seeking to distance ourselves from this controversial deed by the Landwacht.\n\nIn any case, having successfully arrested Kolthek makes it unlikely that the moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop will be capable of working together in a revolt. Our sources already state that they are currently taking over a coastguard vessel to sail to the syndicalist sphere while the Red Front and moderates began to engage in brutal infighting."
 holpostel.94.a: "The Mexicans still won't be pleased."

 holpostel.95.t: "Kolthek Arrested"
 holpostel.95.d: "After having knocked down the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just one block away from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly for Kolthek, they didn't want to grant him refuge, and as such the Landwacht arrested him. Now it seems highly unlikely that any leftist revolt in the short term will succeed, as moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop do not get along so well and the orthodox syndicalists were a binding factor. Our intelligence has suggested that both are now fleeing Groningen by boat into exile as the Red Front and moderates descend into acrimony."
 holpostel.95.a: "Good!"

 holpostel.96.t: "Leftist Revolt"
 holpostel.96.d: "As had been feared, the leftists have taken control of the streets of Groningen, and soon other cities in Friesland, Drenthe and Groningen province followed suit. The rebels have armed themselves and are harboured by a population that supports their efforts to overthrow the government. Unrest is growing in the rest of the country too, and some in the government are saying that it would be wise to set up a government in exile ready to restore rightful Dutch rule in case of collapse. Others, like Queen Wilhelmina, would rather see us try to quash the rebellion with force."
 holpostel.96.a: "The cowardly populist-capitalists flee the mainland."
 holpostel.96.b: "We will crush this rebellion."

 holpostel.101.t: "Provisional Revolutionary Committee"
 holpostel.101.d: "We have ended the liberal parliamentary system that the Netherlands has laboured under for decades, and now we need to lay out the basis for our new socialist state. We will need to propose a new constitutional body that is truly fairly elected by the people without parties in the pockets of the capitalists. To organise all this, we shall form a provisional revolutionary committee, until a new National Assembly is properly elected."
 holpostel.101.a: "Raise the scarlet standard high!"

 holpostel.102.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 holpostel.102.d: "Election day has finally come, by decree of the junta. Soon after this, the military will restore control to the States-General and the Netherlands shall then once again have a civilian government. The main parties believed to stand a chance are the confessionals working together and the SDAP, while the liberals will probably return to their old position of filling in the last seats to a majority."
 holpostel.102.a: "SDAP becomes the largest party!"
 holpostel.102.b: "The RKSP become the largest party!"

 holpostel.103.t: "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.103.d: "The election results are in, and it seems that the social democrats have become the largest party. The initiative to form a government is theirs, and the question is now whether they shall work with the liberals to form a majority, or with the Catholics."
 holpostel.103.a: "They work with the VDB and LSP."
 holpostel.103.b: "They work with the RKSP."

 holpostel.104.t: "Confessionals Form [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.104.d: "The election results are in, and it seems that the conservatives have won. The Catholic RKSP is the largest and the smaller Protestant parties won a decent number of seats as well. The question is now whether or not they work together in the old fashion or will the RKSP claim the 'Torentje' for themselves by working with the social democrats, as the Protestants would not put up with a Catholic prime minister otherwise."
 holpostel.104.a: "CHU leader De Geer unites the Confessionals and Liberals."
 holpostel.104.b: "The RKSP and the SDAP work together."

 holpostel.105.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
 holpostel.105.d: "It is election time again, and people across the Netherlands are heading to the polls. The nation waits with interest whether it will be the social democrats or the conservative confessionals who will claim an election victory."
 holpostel.105.a: "The SDAP wins!"
 holpostel.105.b: "The confessionals win!"

 holpostel.106.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 holpostel.106.d: "Election day has come again, and after a campaigning for several months the politicians are awaiting the exit polls anxiously. The three contenders to become the largest party are the liberals of Pieter Oud, the confessionals who have a divided leadership, and the social democrats, led by Willem Drees. Whoever becomes the largest will get the mandate to form a government."
 holpostel.106.a: "PvdA takes an absolute majority."
 holpostel.106.b: "PvdA takes the plurality."
 holpostel.106.pvdv: "PvdV takes the plurality."
 holpostel.106.vvd: "VVD takes the plurality."
 holpostel.106.e: "The ARP, RKSP and CHU secure themselves a key role."

 holpostel.107.t: "PvdA Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.107.d: "We have secured an absolute majority and thus we can shape the country along our own views. We do not need to compromise with anyone, and we should make sure that our supporters will not be displeased with our progress, or we might face punishment in the next elections."
 holpostel.107.a: "This shall be solely a PvdA cabinet."

 holpostel.108.t: "PvdA Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.108.d: "We have won the elections, and while it is clearly not enough to attain an absolute majority and to rule by ourselves, it is still more than enough for us to get the initiative in the formation of a new government. Several options are available, and it is up to us who we'd prefer as our new partner."
 holpostel.108.a: "Purple with the PvdV."
 holpostel.108.b: "Purple with the VVD."
 holpostel.108.c: "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
 holpostel.108.e: "Bright Red with the RSAP."

 holpostel.109.t: "Liberals Form [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.109.d: "We liberals have come a long way, as we were on a downturn not so long ago; while we did not outright win a majority, we did secure a plurality and that will suffice for us to get the initiative in forming a government. Will the days of liberal domination in the 19th century come again?"
 holpostel.109.a: "Purple with the PvdA."
 holpostel.109.b: "Conservative Liberalism with the CHU and Catholics."
 holpostel.109.c: "Stikkercoalitie: ARP with VNH outside support."

 holpostel.110.t: "Confessionals Form [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.110.d: "The former member parties of the CNA have gathered an impressive outcome in terms of voters: the ARP, CHU and RKSP have each showed solid outcome and as a block no one can move around them, with the RKSP even attaining the plurality."
 holpostel.110.a: "CHU rules centre-right with Oud's liberals, the RKSP and ARP."
 holpostel.110.b: "ARP rules centre with Oud's liberals and Drees' Social Democrats."
 holpostel.110.c: "CHU rules centre-left with the PvdA and ARP."
 holpostel.110.e: "RKSP rules Roman-Red with the PvdA."

 holpostel.111.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 holpostel.111.d: "Election day has come again, and everyone is awaiting the newspaper announcing the exit polls and hopefully soon the final result of the elections. Who has won?"
 holpostel.111.a: "The CNA takes once again an absolute majority."
 holpostel.111.b: "CNA gets the plurality but not the majority."
 holpostel.111.c: "LSP gets the plurality but not the majority."
 holpostel.111.e: "SDAP gets the plurality but not the majority."

 holpostel.112.t: "CNA Forms [GetYear] Government with Absolute Majority"
 holpostel.112.d: "We have done it once again: we have seized more than fifty seats in parliament and given ourselves a comfortable lead over the other parties. Louis Beel will form the next government and he has a comfortable majority at hand in parliament to push through his policies. If we wish to be more inclusive however, we could offer some cabinet positions to liberals."
 holpostel.112.a: "Work with the liberals."
 holpostel.112.b: "Thus, we rule one!"

 holpostel.113.t: "CNA Forms [GetYear] Government with Reduced Majority"
 holpostel.113.d: "While we have been unable to secure the absolute majority like in earlier times, we're still the largest party in parliament by a noticeable margin. As such, we get the initiative in the formation, which will be the first task of Louis Beel as the leader of the CNA."
 holpostel.113.a: "The LSP poses a reliable partner."
 holpostel.113.b: "The SDAP is less radical and therefore viable now."
 holpostel.113.c: "The VNH agrees with us on key points."

 holpostel.114.t: "LSP Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.114.d: "The LSP has secured the plurality of seats by a noticeable margin, and as such we will now get the initiative in the formation of a government. The question that rests is whether we can agree with the CNA on the formation of a government or with the VNH."
 holpostel.114.a: "Now we shall govern with the CNA."
 holpostel.114.b: "Now we shall govern with the VNH."

 holpostel.115.t: "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holpostel.115.d: "We have secured the plurality of seats and now time has come to do something with it. As we lack an outright majority, we will have to compromise. We could work with the liberals, with the Catholics, or we could go for a full socialist government and work with the RSAP."
 holpostel.115.a: "Purple with the LSP and VDB."
 holpostel.115.b: "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
 holpostel.115.c: "Deep-Red with the RSAP."

 holpostel.117.t: "Second Prussian Intervention"
 holpostel.117.d: "Syndicalists have taken over the Netherlands, exposing a vulnerable flank through which the Ruhr area, our primary industrial centre can be hit. Military hotheads are proposing that we invade right now, while they still lack international recognition, but the Dutch, or Batavians as they call themselves now, are surely dug in having expected this move already. Others propose that we send agents to undermine the new regime's stability, which could be a more subtle way of securing their loyalty. The third possibility is to just leave them alone - direct intervention might escalate into full-out war with the Internationale."
 holpostel.117.a: "Send the agents!"
 holpostel.117.b: "Send the soldiers!"
 holpostel.117.c: "Send the border guards!"

 holpostel.118.t: "The Prussians Intervene once more!"
 holpostel.118.d: "Just like in 1787, when the Dutch republic was overtaken by revolutionaries who ousted the Dutch republic, the reactionaries from the east have come to put the Dutch people back in chains. Not again is our creed! We shall fight for our future as any proud people would!\n\nUp with Batavian virgin and down with the 'mof'!"
 holpostel.118.a: "Eerst was hier de Pruis in 't land..."

 holpostel.119.t: "German Destabilisation efforts"
 holpostel.119.d: "The Kaiser has noticed the takeover of our righteous government and chose to send agents destabilising our regime. Even if this makes our government a bit more secure for now, it still hurts, as these people are clearly having a harmful effect on our grip over the situation."
 holpostel.119.a: "Ze zullen ons niet krijgen!"

 holpostel.122.t: "The Question of Surinamese Independence"
 holpostel.122.d: "With the ascension of the worker's state in the Netherlands, the situation of Dutch Guyana, also known as Suriname, is becoming an embarrassing affair: it does not fit a modern worker's nation to maintain an archaic testament of imperialism. While there does not seem to be a very extensive independence movement in the region, likely due to the lacking development of the area, proposals have been pitched to send the exiled independence activist Anton de Kom back to Paramaribo to establish a socialist republic in Suriname."
 holpostel.122.a: "Suriname deserves its independence"
 holpostel.122.b: "Isn't it more imperialistic to force their independence?!"

### Focus Events ###
 hol.200.t: "The Dutch Army Plan"
 hol.200.d: "Tensions are running high around us, causing our army staff to hold a meeting to decide upon a doctrine for our army.\n\nThe more traditional part of our general staff wishes to concentrate on the defence of our country, repairing and reactivating the traditional defensive lines making use of the water to stop the enemy.\n\nHowever, some note that these tactics may not work anymore due to the changing nature of warfare, and have expressed that the Dutch army should be a highly mobile force capable with motorised troops and tanks to respond to threats quickly and decisively."
 hol.200.a: "An important choice will be made soon."

 hol.201.t: "The Future of the Dutch Navy"
 hol.201.d: "The Admiralty is discussing the best way to proceed onwards. Our resources are limited, so a plan is needed to be devised on how to make use of our naval assets the most.\n\nSome of the admiralty place our merchant fleet above all. They believe that if the merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible, harass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\n\nArguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heard. Our capital ships are reaching a respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\nSome propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future. They wish to see a further expansion of the carrier force supported by a strong naval aviation branch."
 hol.201.a: "An important choice will be made soon."

 holfocus.4.t: "The Search For Resources"
 holfocus.4.d: "Although the vast majority of our resources come from our colonies, our homeland should also harbour some resources we have not yet uncovered.\n\nGeological surveys in Brabant have found traces of tungsten, a resource we thus far completely lack. Furthermore, we can dig deeper in our mines in southern Limburg and perhaps find usable iron for our smelters to produce steel from."
 holfocus.4.a: "Less reliance on foreign steel would be nice."
 holfocus.4.b: "We could really use the tungsten."
 holfocus.4.c: "Why not both? We will pay for it! Somehow..."

 holfocus.5.t: "Iron Discovered in Limburg!"
 holfocus.5.d: "Our mining efforts are successful, there is indeed usable iron in the mines of Limburg, boosting our steel production considerably!"
 holfocus.5.a: "Fantastisch!"

 holfocus.6.t: "Tungsten Discovered in Limburg!"
 holfocus.6.d: "The surveys were right, there is indeed tungsten in our country. This will certainly prove useful for our military industry."
 holfocus.6.a: "Heerlijk!"

 holfocus.7.t: "Vesting Holland"
 holfocus.7.d: "We have started with the construction of Vesting Holland. The plan will be to surround Holland, the industrial and political heart of the Netherlands, with fortifications so that our defensive positions will be secure in any future war. Should we start construction?"
 holfocus.7.a: "Begin!"
 holfocus.7.b: "Rather not."

 holfocus.8.t: "Vesting Holland's First Stage Completed"
 holfocus.8.d: "Phase 1 of Vesting Holland has been completed: a limited layer of fortifications hopefully capable of strengthening our defensive capabilities to at least an extent. The project is not finished, however, as much more can be done."
 holfocus.8.a: "Voortreffelijk!"

 holfocus.9.t: "Vesting Holland Completed"
 holfocus.9.d: "We have completed Vesting Holland. Our most important defensive lines are sufficiently secured, and any enemy would have to go through a lot more trouble to reach our homeland. While perhaps it might be possible to fortify Fortress Holland even more, this at least sets up a basis we can work with!"
 holfocus.9.a: "We can sleep easy at night now!"

 holfocus.10.t: "Question of the SDAP"
 holfocus.10.d: "Following the removal of the shackles of capitalist rule, the workers have successfully abolished the States-General and are preparing to elect a third National Assembly. One of the first orders of business is whether to allow the SDAP to partake in the upcoming elections; most other remnants of bourgeois elitism may not, but the SDAP have once before tried to jumpstart the revolution, granting them some measure of grudging respect amongst other leftist groups. Unfortunately, the SDAP have been drifting to the right in recent years, which is one of our main concerns - they could provide a backdoor to subvert the revolution."
 holfocus.10.a: "Let the SDAP take part."
 holfocus.10.b: "Reject SDAP admissions as communal representatives."

 holfocus.11.t: "Third National Assembly Elected"
 holfocus.11.d: "Following an election, every municipal commune has sent their representatives to the third National Assembly. This assembly will decide over the future of the new Dutch order."
 holfocus.11.a: "Good."

 holfocus.18.t: "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
 holfocus.18.d: "Early this morning, the Landwacht was found to be unusually active on the streets of Amsterdam. Around 10 a group of around seventy-five Landwachters was spotted marching into the Palace on the edge of Dam Square, the place where Henri Swart's office is. Upon entry into the office their intentions have quickly become clear: they are demanding that Swart publicly resign from his position and prepare for a handover of power. With Swart placed on air on the national broadcaster, the nation's fate hangs on a knife-edge."
 holfocus.18.a: "The police burst in and seize the conspirators."
 holfocus.18.b: "Swart publicly resigns."

 holfocus.19.t: "Trade Mission"
 holfocus.19.d: "The Netherlands, to put it bluntly, is an export economy. One of the main issues affecting our nations in recent years is that almost all of our exports go to Germany, meaning that now that the Reich's willingness to engage in overseas trade has plummeted, our own economy suffers. To diversify our export partners, we could approach the nearby Scandinavians, or look beyond Europe to the Americas for new markets."
 holfocus.19.a: "Send the mission to Scandinavia."
 holfocus.19.b: "Send the mission to North America."
 holfocus.19.c: "Send the mission to South America."

 holfocus.20.t: "Dutch Trade Mission Arrives"
 holfocus.20.d: "A Dutch trade mission has arrived. They hope to negotiate a treaty so that at least some trade barriers can be removed, a highly unusual request in these times of crisis. Regardless, agreeing to it could boost our trade with each other, but cynics point out that this is probably more an attempt by the Dutch to get out of German economic dependency than them caring for our mutual economic prospects."
 holfocus.20.a: "Trade barriers begone."
 holfocus.20.b: "No, the barriers are fine as it is."

 holfocus.21.t: "Trade Mission Reports Back"
 holfocus.21.d: "Our trade mission has returned from their trip. Outside of great stories of those who came along about what had happened during it they are also reporting on the gains they have made."
 holfocus.21.a: "Let's see!"

 holfocus.22.t: "Welfare Negotiations"
 holfocus.22.d: "One of the first demands the leftists came up with was some limited reforms in welfare and regulation; ranging from shorter working hours to mandatory safety regulation to subsidies for unemployed and those not able to work at all."
 holfocus.22.a: "A despicably un-Dutch proposal!"
 holfocus.22.b: "Some reforms should be fine."
 holfocus.22.c: "Implement all of their reforms."

 holfocus.23.t: "Communard Diplomatic Status Negotiations"
 holfocus.23.d: "While most 'conventional' countries have the tendency to recognise governments-in-exile like Canada and the French Exiles over the syndicalists ruling their homeland, the Netherlands were also one of the few countries who viciously refused to even de-facto recognising their existence. That may change now, because the leftists demand we negotiate with the Commune of France for a diplomatic mission in the interests of our citizens travelling there."
 holfocus.23.a: "We don't negotiate with terrorists!"
 holfocus.23.b: "Fine, but we will explicitly deny de-facto recognition!"
 holfocus.23.c: "Alright, but we won't say this is de-jure recognition!"

 holfocus.24.t: "Anti-Landwacht Protection Negotiations"
 holfocus.24.d: "The leftists are demanding that we divert manpower in order to protect them from 'blackshirted thugs', after consulting our spy in the NAS it was found out that they meant the Landwacht with this. Still, diverting our precious manpower to defending some lefties is especially in CNA spheres seen as completely unacceptable!"
 holfocus.24.a: "We're not going to do that."
 holfocus.24.b: "Divert a few reservists."
 holfocus.24.c: "Give them what they want."

 holfocus.25.t: "Red Front Restriction Negotiations"
 holfocus.25.d: "The Red Front is arguably one of the biggest threats to civil peace in the Netherlands as they have a tendency to constantly brawl with the Landwacht. Demanding that they restrain themselves in the deal is a no-brainer, but the lefties won't just go for that."
 holfocus.25.a: "Demand must cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
 holfocus.25.b: "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Landwacht."
 holfocus.25.c: "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

 holfocus.26.t: "NAS Negotiations"
 holfocus.26.d: "The NAS, arguably the most important syndicalist union in the Netherlands, has the potential to bring our economy to ruin and furthermore, taking at away will damage the influence of orthodox syndicalism, probably badly!"
 holfocus.26.a: "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
 holfocus.26.b: "They must merge with the social democratic NVV!"
 holfocus.26.c: "Don't make demands of them."

 holfocus.27.t: "RSAP Negotiations"
 holfocus.27.d: "The RSAP is the only far-left party represented in parliament, mainly because the rest of the left rejects our parliament's legitimacy. Still, they are a threat to our current system, as they would no doubt dissolve it if they came to power. Limiting what they can do will diminish the political influence of the radical socialists as well."
 holfocus.27.a: "They must dissolve themselves!"
 holfocus.27.b: "Demand they refrain from activity in strikes and demonstrations."
 holfocus.27.c: "Don't make demands of them."

 holfocus.28.t: "Landwacht Restrictions Negotiations"
 holfocus.28.d: "The Landwacht is an obvious problem with regards to keeping the streets of the Netherlands safe, as they seem to constantly start brawling with left-wingers. The Dutch government wants to make clear that the Landwacht should make way for the police to round up troublemakers where needed."
 holfocus.28.a: "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
 holfocus.28.b: "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Red Front."
 holfocus.28.c: "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

 holfocus.29.t: "Military Influence Negotiations"
 holfocus.29.d: "A large problem is that a lot of old-guard officers in our military are members of the VNH on behalf of their 'moderate-but-still-authoritarian' faction. This undermines the reliability of our military and makes a putsch by the VNH possible. We are determined to change this, and more so by altering their party rules."
 holfocus.29.a: "Demand that one can no longer be actively in the military and be a VNH-member."
 holfocus.29.b: "Make sure that active military personnel can no longer become VNH-members."
 holfocus.29.c: "Don't push this issue."

 holfocus.30.t: "VNH Rally Negotiations"
 holfocus.30.d: "One of the most important reasons that the VNH is growing so fast in recent years is that Van Geelkerken is holding enormous party rallies propagating a future under the VNH. This leads to growth of a radical young guard and it is proving to be a threat to our parliamentary system."
 holfocus.30.a: "Demand that these rallies will no longer be held."
 holfocus.30.b: "Only allow it at the annual VNH landdag."
 holfocus.30.c: "Don't put restrictions on it like that."

 holfocus.31.t: "Union Rights Negotiations"
 holfocus.31.d: "The first demand the VNH placed down was that we ban trade unions as they are, as the VNH's Van Geelkerken states, 'thugs who only seek to sabotage our nation'. This would be neither stabilising nor popular, however."
 holfocus.31.a: "Strong unions are vital to our society."
 holfocus.31.b: "Limit their rights, but don't outright ban them."
 holfocus.31.c: "Ban the unions as demanded."

 holfocus.32.t: "Tariff Negotiations"
 holfocus.32.d: "The VNH demands that we protect Dutch businesses through tariffs to make foreign goods more expensive. The Netherlands is an export country however and overdoing this is risking a trade war that we cannot afford, so the government must remain cautious."
 holfocus.32.a: "We don't do tariffs."
 holfocus.32.b: "Some tariffs are acceptable."
 holfocus.32.c: "Implement all the tariffs they want."

 holfocus.33.t: "Nationalisation Negotiations"
 holfocus.33.d: "The most controversial demand of the populists was that we would nationalise all German property in the Netherlands. Some are afraid that doing this will bring upon us the wrath of the Kaiserreich."
 holfocus.33.a: "We're nationalising nothing!"
 holfocus.33.b: "Germans don't need all that property."
 holfocus.33.c: "We'll nationalise all German property."

 holfocus.34.t: "Successful Negotiations with the Syndicalists"
 holfocus.34.d: "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme left. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
 holfocus.34.a: "Excellent news!"

 holfocus.36.t: "Negotiations Failed with the Syndicalists"
 holfocus.36.d: "The syndicalists have left the negotiation as they feel we are willing to give away too little to force actual change through. As such the negotiations have fallen apart and the chances of a deal are now minimal."
 holfocus.36.a: "Sodding reds."

 holfocus.37.t: "Successful Negotiations with the Nationalists"
 holfocus.37.d: "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme right. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
 holfocus.37.a: "Neat."

 holfocus.39.t: "Negotiations Failed with the Nationalists"
 holfocus.39.d: "The VNH has left the negotiation table as they feel that 'we are too weak to even stand a chance at saving the country' and that they would have to give too much away to end with a deal. Negotiations have thus fallen apart and of the chances a deal after all are slim."
 holfocus.39.a: "These extremists really are a piece of work."

 holfocus.41.t: "Dutch Diplomatic Mission"
 holfocus.41.d.a: "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, which amounts to de-facto recognition of our existence, something they have not shown before. It could be a chance to make sure our citizens have some place to turn to when in the Netherlands, but our sources have told us that they agreed to do this only by the grace of having negotiated with their local syndicalists, so we could perhaps extract more."
 holfocus.41.d.b: "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, though they have said that this amounts to no recognition of our government at all. This is insulting, but our sources say this move stems from negotiations with our comrades there, so perhaps we could pressure them into recognising our government."
 holfocus.41.a: "Accept the proposal."
 holfocus.41.b: "Demand de-jure recognition by the Dutch government."

 holfocus.42.t: "France Accepts the Mission"
 holfocus.42.d: "The French have accepted our proposal to exchange diplomatic missions, and the necessary preparations to buy a building in Paris and The Hague by our countries respectively has started. The syndicalists will be satisfied which will cement our deal."
 holfocus.42.a: "I still don't like this."

 holfocus.43.t: "France Demands De-Jure Recognition"
 holfocus.43.d: "The French have said that they will only accept our proposal if we officially recognise their government, something objectively not possible without repealing our recognition of [NFA.GetNameDef]. Besides that, it also makes our government look weak. Not doing it might jeopardise our deal with the left though..."
 holfocus.43.a: "Never!"
 holfocus.43.b: "Ok then..."

 holfocus.44.t: "Dutch Diplomatic Recognition"
 holfocus.44.d: "The Dutch government has given in to our pressure and is now recognising us as the legitimate government of France. Their government has suffered a humiliating political loss while we have gained a massive diplomatic win on the world stage."
 holfocus.44.a: "Pressure helps!"

 holfocus.45.t: "Holland Refuses to Recognise Us"
 holfocus.45.d: "Despite our pressure, the Dutch have refused to recognise us. While this means no diplomatic missions it is not particularly crushing for us. We could however tell the Dutch syndicalists how awfully unreasonable their government was, with their outrageous demands... like... well we will just have to make something up!"
 holfocus.45.a: "No, it's better to just leave it at this!"
 holfocus.45.b: "Let me think of some outrageous demands..."

 holfocus.46.t: "Syndicalists Protest"
 holfocus.46.d: "When we didn't hear back from the French, we assumed that it was no deal. However, now the syndicalist negotiators have appeared saying that we made outrageous demands of the French government and that we intentionally blew the negotiations to punish them..."
 holfocus.46.a: "OK, OK, we'll recognise them!"
 holfocus.46.b: "We deny this and we won't go back."

 holfocus.47.t: "The Netherlands Nationalises German Property"
 holfocus.47.d.a: "The Dutch government has announced a large-scale nationalisation programme following negotiations with their ultranationalists. They are targeting German property across their country and voices from left to right of the political spectrum are calling for action to defend German interests."
 holfocus.47.d.b: "The Dutch government has announced a small-scale nationalisation programme that seems to be solely targeting Germans. There has been some outrage in German politics about this and there are calls for us to do something to safeguard German interests in our small neighbour."
 holfocus.47.a: "The German military will safeguard German interests."
 holfocus.47.b: "Give it up or lose access to the Reichspakt markets."
 holfocus.47.c: "There is nothing we can do."

 holfocus.48.t: "German Military Ultimatum"
 holfocus.48.d: "The Germans have sent an ultimatum: either we cancel our nationalisation plans or the German Heer will intervene to protect German interests by force. It appears like we have little choice but to cancel, even if it would not be popular with our new nationalistic partners or even moderates."
 holfocus.48.a: "They're bluffing!"
 holfocus.48.b: "We would be squashed under their heel."

 holfocus.49.t: "Dutch Refuse our Ultimatum"
 holfocus.49.d: "The Dutch apparently think we are bluffing, and have refused to call off the nationalisation. While not attacking now would have us lose face in the international community, some are saying that it is unwise to attack a 'normal' country while the syndicalists knock at our gates. Besides, that nationalisation is hardly a valid casus belli."
 holfocus.49.a: "War it is!"
 holfocus.49.b: "Don't act on it."

 holfocus.50.t: "German Economic Ultimatum"
 holfocus.50.d: "The Kaiserreich has demanded that we cancel our nationalisation, and that if we fail to do so they will remove our access to the Reichspakt market, which could potentially ruin our economy. Caving in will likely anger our nationalistic partners however."
 holfocus.50.a: "Thanks to policy and Black Monday we can afford it."
 holfocus.50.b: "We have no choice."

 holfocus.51.t: "Dutch Refuse our Ultimatum"
 holfocus.51.d: "In spite of our threats, the Dutch have refused to cancel the nationalisation process. Now it is up to us to decide whether we will go through with our threat or just let it slide."
 holfocus.51.a: "You'll get your embargo."
 holfocus.51.b: "Sliding sounds nice."

 holfocus.52.t: "Dutch Cave In"
 holfocus.52.d: "Following our pressure the Dutch have caved in and German property will not be nationalised. Those owning assets in the Netherlands have cheered the strong reaction of the German government and showered praise upon us for not letting them be bullied by our tiny neighbour's government."
 holfocus.52.a: "That will teach them."

 holfocus.53.t: "VNH Publicly Denounces Us"
 holfocus.53.d: "Our 'partners', the VNH, have publicly denounced the way we handled the German diplomatic row, saying that we failed to do what it took to serve our country's best interest and that we let the German violate our sovereignty. So much for our deal."
 holfocus.53.a: "It can hardly be cancelled if it never truly existed!"

 holfocus.54.t: "Government Negotiations Collapse"
 holfocus.54.d: "Following the failure to negotiate a deal with either the left or the right, the CNA and LSP are both polling at historically low levels, with most of their voters having defected to the SDAP and VDB. At the same time, the far left and far right are intending to boycott the elections. The LSP has sought to return to the negotiating table, but the CNA claims the time for talk is over. It turns out they couldn't get out."
 holfocus.54.a: "We need new elections in a few months' time!"

 holfocus.55.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 holfocus.55.d: "Following the fall of the Cabinet of the CNA and LSP, elections were ordered to be held. The SDAP and VDB are said to stand a good chance as their interventions have caused the CNA and LSP to lose a lot of support and their bad experience with working with the democratic parties had caused both the VNH and the RSAP to boycott the elections, at least this time around."
 holfocus.55.a: "The SDAP beats the CNA."
 holfocus.55.b: "The CNA remains the largest, but loses its majority."

 holfocus.56.t: "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holfocus.56.d: "Having become the largest party in the house, the SDAP get the first chance to form a government. It has not taken long to make a deal with the VDB, who are the only ones willing to rule with them. The only dark spot of the whole affair has been that Queen Wilhelmina has refused to give Albarda the post of Formateur, meaning that it would have to be filled by VDB-leader Oud."
 holfocus.56.a: "And so cabinet Oud came to be."

 holfocus.57.t: "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
 holfocus.57.d: "While the CNA again stood victorious, we unfortunately lost our majority. While we got the first shot at forming a government, we discovered that cruelly we could only do so if we made a deal with the SDAP or VDB who saw each other as preferable partners. After failing to find a viable partner, we had to give the SDAP a chance. The SDAP formed a cabinet with the VDB, for unknown reasons, though it is said the Queen was involved in negotiating that."
 holfocus.57.a: "... but we won!"

 holfocus.58.t: "Prime Secretary of the External Affairs"
 holfocus.58.d: "Die Dritte Nationalversammlung took to electing the 'Eerste Secretaris der Externe Zaken' of the Batavian Commune - leading the department of external affairs. There are multiple individuals running for this office, but only those endorsed by a faction stand a real chance of winning as representatives that stand as independents, while not unimportant, are unable to swing crucial votes."
 holfocus.58.a: "Patriot Paul de Groot."
 holfocus.58.b: "NAS's Nicolaas Beuzemaker."
 holfocus.58.cc: "KAPN's Benjamin Lopes Cardazo."
 holfocus.58.c: "RSAP's Willem van Ravesteyn."
 holfocus.58.e: "SDAP's Charles Guillaume Cramer."

 holfocus.59.t: "Prime Secretary of the Economy"
 holfocus.59.d: "Die Dritte Nationalversammlung is now electing the 'Eerste Secretaris der Economie' of the Batavian Commune - who will be in charge of the department of economics. Again, the factions have put forward their candidates, and again it will probably be in the hands of independents in the National Assembly who will rise to the top."
 holfocus.59.a: "Patriotten's Louis 'Lou' de Visser."
 holfocus.59.b: "NAS's Jan Postma."
 holfocus.59.cc: "KAPN's Abraham Verduin."
 holfocus.59.c: "RSAP's Jacques de Kadt."
 holfocus.59.e: "SDAP's Jacob van Gelderen."

 holfocus.60.t: "Prime Secretary of Internal Affairs"
 holfocus.60.d: "Now the third National Assembly is electing the 'Eerste Secretaris der Interne Zaken' - depending on who will be appointed, the new system of justice will be shaped. If a hardliner secures this position, freedom in the commune might be jeopardised."
 holfocus.60.a: "Patriotten's Bernhard Coltof."
 holfocus.60.b: "NAS's Jan Berger."
 holfocus.60.cc: "KAPN's Henriette Holst."
 holfocus.60.c: "RSAP's Fokke Bosman."
 holfocus.60.e: "SDAP's Jacob van Gelderen."

 holfocus.61.t: "Chairman of the Volksraad"
 holfocus.61.d: "Now all members of the Volksraad have been appointed. Only one position has not been given away, chairmanship of the Volksraad, the head of government of the Batavian Commune leading chairing the Volksraad. The leaders of each faction have already announced their candidacy."
 holfocus.61.a: "First Patriot David Wijnkoop."
 holfocus.61.b: "NAS-Chairman Harm Kolthek."
 holfocus.61.cc: "KAPN-theorist Anton Pannekoek."
 holfocus.61.c: "RSAP-leader Henk Sneevliet."
 holfocus.61.e: "SDAP party leader Willem Albarda."

 holfocus.62.t: "Patriots Gain a Majority"
 holfocus.62.d: "The Patriot movement had the overwhelming support of the independents who appear not so independent after all. The first law of the Volksraad was that of filling the post of council pensionary, henceforth filled by David Wijnkoop until his death, which went flawlessly through the National Assembly. Undoubtedly the new constitution will fully suit the needs of the patriots."
 holfocus.62.a: "Batavian democracy was a brief experience."

 holfocus.63.t: "NAS Gains a Majority"
 holfocus.63.d: "The Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat and their unionist philosophy has clearly won the hearts of a majority of the people. The delegates of every Dutch commune have granted their representatives a majority in the Volksraad. The newly assembled Volksraad has elected Jacques de Kadt as the first council pensionary of the Batavian Commune. The Volksraad has now started drafting a constitution that will determine the rules of state."
 holfocus.63.a: "The unions will get a special place."

 holfocus.64.t: "RSAP Gains a Majority"
 holfocus.64.d: "Henk Sneevliet left the National Assembly today announcing that the RSAP has gained a majority in the Volksraad, the executive organ of the Batavian Commune, owing to their support from the National Assembly. Sneevliet also announced that the Volksraad had expressed their trust in him as first council pensionary of the new nation."
 holfocus.64.a: "Pensionary Sneevliet it is."

 holfocus.65.t: "SDAP Gains a Majority"
 holfocus.65.d: "The SDAP has received support from the most delegates in the National Assembly, culminating in control over the Volksraad. Willem Albarda declared over the radio that he would not run for pensionary, leaving this office to Willem Drees instead. This is because one of the new constitution's clauses will be that anyone running for pensionary cannot simultaneously run for chairman of the Volksraad."
 holfocus.65.a: "Is the revolution subverted now?"

 holfocus.66.t: "Hung Assembly"
 holfocus.66.d: "The delegates of the communes clearly did not agree on the future of the nation, as the Volksraad and Assembly are divided into rivalling factionalism. No majority has been attained, and the factions are debating whether a coalition can be formed through compromise. At the same time however, Red Front leader Paul de Groot, together with a few patriots, is openly denouncing how the revolution just resembles another flavour of indecisive parliamentarism, and with some patriots openly supporting such a move, it appears his calls will be heard if no deal can be made soon."
 holfocus.66.a: "Sneevliet and Albarda make a deal."
 holfocus.66.b: "RSAP and NAS see an option."
 holfocus.66.c: "The Red Front launches a coup against the government."

 holfocus.68.t: "Die Rheinlinie"
 holfocus.68.d: "One of the policies of the VNH to recover from Black Monday was a Schachtian project to have people build fortifications along the Rhine as a safeguard against a hypothetical advance of the syndicalists from France. This way, it was argued, did the government both spend money to increase the purchasing power of the common man, while also preparing for the future."
 holfocus.68.a: "No syndicalist shall set foot beyond the Rhine!"

 holfocus.69.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Seeks an Alliance"
 holfocus.69.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] have expressed their desire to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName].. How should we respond?"

 holfocus.70.d: "The Germans have accepted our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName]."
 holfocus.70.a: "Great!"

 holfocus.71.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Request"
 holfocus.71.d: "The Germans have declined our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName], saying we wouldn't be able to help. This is an insult."

 holfocus.74.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] have declined our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName], saying that we wouldn't be able to help. This is an insult."
 holfocus.74.a: "Their loss."

 holfocus.75.t: "Help the Netherlands"
 holfocus.75.d: "The Japanese are attacking [HOL.GetNameDef] in hopes of taking their colony in Indonesia. There is some fear among the Australasian general staff however that if the Japanese are allowed to take over the area, they will use it as a staging ground to invade Australia: they are calling upon us to approach the Dutch for an alliance before the fight inevitably reaches Sydney or Melbourne."
 holfocus.75.a: "Approach the Dutch authorities."
 holfocus.75.b: "No, the Japanese will surely leave us alone."

 holfocus.76.t: "Australasia Proposes An Alliance"
 holfocus.76.d: "Australasia proposes that we join the Entente and that they in turn will help us in our struggle against the Japanese. What do we say?"
 holfocus.76.a: "We're in!"
 holfocus.76.b: "Don't worry, we can handle this alone!"

 holfocus.77.t: "Australasia Negotiates with the Dutch"
 holfocus.77.d: "Australasia has let us know that they intend to negotiate with the Dutch to have them join the Entente as they suspect that the Japanese will come for them after they conquer the Indonesian archipelago and prefer to have the fight be there instead of in Australia and New Zealand themselves. We can still refuse them if we do not want to be pulled into a war with Japan, though the European Netherlands could in the future also prove a good staging ground against the Kaiserreich."
 holfocus.77.a: "A good initiative."
 holfocus.77.b: "We do not want war with Japan."

 holfocus.78.t: "The Netherlands Joins the Entente"
 holfocus.78.d: "The Netherlands has agreed to our plan and has joined the Entente. It is time to mobilise the Australian people in defence of our nation!"
 holfocus.78.a: "Okay then!"

 holfocus.79.t: "Canada Disapproves"
 holfocus.79.d: "The Canadians have let us know that they do not wish us to join the war against the Japanese in South East Asia."
 holfocus.79.a: "Then we will pull back."

 holfocus.86.t: "Policy on Belgium"
 holfocus.86.d: "Now that we have stabilised the country and can look outwards again, we have to evaluate our policy towards the southern part of the Lowlands. Some people say that it is best for both sides if we maintain friendly relations with the rulers of Belgium. There is however, especially on the far-right, also a lobby that demands we stake our claims on Flanders, where most people speak Dutch too and which should, by that logic, be part of the Dutch state."
 holfocus.86.a: "We must unite the Dutch speaking peoples under one flag!"
 holfocus.86.b: "Belgo-Dutch friendship is mutually beneficial!"

 holfocus.87.t: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] Demands Flanders"
 holfocus.87.d: "The [HOL.GetAdjective] have delivered us an ultimatum: they want us to evacuate Flanders and transfer it to their control or we will face war. While we are confident that we would be able to crush this Dutch menace, the question is whether it would not be cheaper to just give them Flanders."
 holfocus.87.a: "Just give them the damn place."
 holfocus.87.b: "Come and get it!"

 holfocus.88.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Cedes Flanders"
 holfocus.88.d: "Somewhat to our surprise, the [From.GetAdjective] have agreed to our demands and ceded Flanders to our control. The Dutch army is marching into Flanders with great pride and there are small crowds of Flemish-nationalists welcoming them in the streets of Antwerp, Gent and Brugge. While certainly not everyone is happy with this state of affairs, most people seem indifferent."
 holfocus.88.a: "Welkom, medeburgers!"

 holfocus.89.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Demands"
 holfocus.89.d: "In their infinite foolishness, the [From.GetAdjective] have failed to respond in a timely manner to our ultimatum. It appears that we will have to fight to get what is rightfully ours."
 holfocus.89.a: "You've asked for it!"

 holfocus.90.t: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] Attempts to Seize Flanders"
 holfocus.90.d: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] has sent an ultimatum to the [fla_controller.GetAdjective] occupiers of Flanders demanding that they evacuate it and hand it over to them, completely foregoing the fact that Flanders is functionally our possession. While we can hardly declare war on them for tampering with our enemy, they can be sure that once we have them beaten, we will be back to claim what's ours!"
 holfocus.90.a: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] never forgets!"

 holfocus.91.t: "Die Südafrika-Frage"
 holfocus.91.d: "Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Dutch government lends a helping, if subtle, hand to the descendants of Dutch colonists in South Africa, boosted by a strong public opinion in the Netherlands in favour of the former. At the turn of the 20th century, however, this sentiment started to change, perhaps under influence of the 'apartheid' concept. The question is whether we should continue supporting the Boers or whether we should support the Dominionist side instead, who have the moral high ground and are in fact also represented by descendants of Dutch colonists such as Smuts and Hofmeyr."
 holfocus.91.a: "Continue our support for the Boers."
 holfocus.91.b: "We shall support democracy in South Africa henceforth."

 holfocus.92.t: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Research Programme"
 holfocus.92.d: "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] has suggested the idea of a new joint-research programme, in the hopes that sharing our scientific findings will be mutually beneficial and help us improve relations."
 holfocus.92.a: "Sounds like a plan."
 holfocus.92.b: "Thanks but no thanks!"

 holfocus.93.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts!"
 holfocus.93.d: "We have received an answer from [From.GetNameDef]! They accepted our proposal to start a joint research programme and it is going into effect as we speak."
 holfocus.93.a: "Sharing is caring!"

 holfocus.94.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines!"
 holfocus.94.d: "Doubtlessly after careful deliberation, [From.GetNameDef] has decided that it is not in their best interests to start a joint research programme with us."
 holfocus.94.a: "But what about 'sharing is caring'?"

 holfocus.95.t: "Council Communists Receive Majority Backing"
 holfocus.95.d: "Anton Pannekoek and his council communist 'Communist Labour Party of the Netherlands' have won the day and gained a majority in the Volksraad and the National Assembly. The first law put out by the KAPN government abolishes the previously-formed post of council pensionary and lets the Volksraad as a whole function as the head of state of our Commune."
 holfocus.95.a: "A commune of councils it will be!"

 holfocus.101.t: "Socialists Dissolve the Government"
 holfocus.101.d: "Following their successful takeover in the recent elections, the socialists have declared that the old government is gone and that new one shall be built upon the old."
 holfocus.101.a: "Long live the worker!"

### Dutch navy focuses events

 holnavy.3.t: "A New O-Class Submarine"
 holnavy.3.d: "The first submarine minelayer to serve for the Netherlands, the O19 class are the largest Dutch submarine design to date, displacing 998 tons. They were also the fastest, capable of 19.25 knots surfaced (and 9 knots submerged). Armament comprised of eight 530mm torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern, 2 external amidships), a dual-purpose 88mm deck gun, two 40mm Bofors guns and a 12.7mm machine gun, giving them a very strong anti-aircraft capability for a pre-war submarine.\n\nProbably the most innovative element of the design was the world's first operational submarine snorkel, a pipe that enabled the diesel engines to be run at periscope depth."
 holnavy.3.a: "That looks dangerous, I'd rather not!"
 holnavy.3.a.tt: "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\nGrants the standard tech tree design."
 holnavy.3.b: "Implement snorkels on all our designs!"
 holnavy.3.b.tt: "Make some alterations to the submarine design."

 holnavy.4.t: "A New Colonial Submarine"
 holnavy.4.d: "Most of our so called 'K-class' submarines are getting quite old. These submarines are specifically designed for patrol duties in the warm waters of the Indies. A new design with the latest technological advances in submarine design will bolster our ability of keeping the Dutch East Indies defendable or even cause the diversion of enemy ships to counter these submarines. With these newer designs, we cannot only make them patrol boats, but design them to operate further away from bases as well by specifically improving their endurance."
 holnavy.4.a: "We'll opt for a more well-rounded design."
 holnavy.4.a.tt: "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible. Grants the standard tech tree design.\n"
 holnavy.4.b: "Ensure these submarines will be able to operate far from their bases."
 holnavy.4.b.tt: "Make some alterations to the submarine design. This will make her more expensive however."

 holnavy.1.t: "Anti-Submarine Destroyer Designs"
 holnavy.1.d: "Our trade routes to our colonies are long and so can be easily intercepted by enemy submarines. We can therefore opt to specialise our smaller ships in an anti-submarine role, by equipping them with the newest submarine-detecting technologies and additional weaponry to counter them.\n\nThis will make them somewhat more expensive though."
 holnavy.1.a: "Send the design to the shipyards as it is."
 holnavy.1.a.tt: "§YGrants a research bonus for next standard destroyer design.§!\n"
 holnavy.1.b: "Specialise the design in Anti-Submarine Warfare!"
 holnavy.1.b.tt: "§YGrants a destroyer variant with increased ASW and reduced torpedo loads of the current tech level.§!\n"

 holnavy.13.t: "Flotilla Leader Cruiser"
 holnavy.13.d: "As we possess a rather large arsenal of destroyers. rather than building full sized cruisers, we opt for a design which is considerably smaller yet retains its cruiser like armament. These ships will act as the leader of a squadron of destroyers.\n\nThe planned design as is, codenamed 'Argonaut 600', has a displacement of just 3500 tonnes, but will be armed with 6 150mm guns, and equipped with a decent amount of AA and ASW equipment. She will also carry a Fokker C.XI(W) floatplane. The small size will come at the cost of nearly no armour protection but will make these cruisers to be considerably cheaper to produce."
 holnavy.13.a: "Small, nimble and affordable, just as our navy needs."
 holnavy.13.a.tt: "§YGrants a research bonus for next standard cruiser design.§!\n"
 holnavy.13.b: "Small, nimble and affordable, just as our navy needs."
 holnavy.13.b.tt: "§YGrants a small and cheap cruiser variant of the current tech level.§!\n"

 holnavy.5.t: "Kijkduin Class Light Cruiser"
 holnavy.5.d: "Our preceding cruiser classes were far too thinly armoured to contest the larger light cruisers being built by Japan, prompting a new design.\n\nWith these cruisers likely forming the backbone of our navy, providing vital support to the bigger capital ships. With a preliminary design (named 'Kijkduin' for now) ready, we can continue with this project or we can opt to make increase the budget per ship and make further improvements to it.\n\nWe can also attempt to bolster our numbers by making these cruisers considerably cheaper, and hope they do not blow up by the first shell to land on its deck."
 holnavy.5.a: "Good, we need the design as soon as possible!"
 holnavy.5.a.tt: "§YGrants a standard cruiser variant of the current tech level.§!"
 holnavy.5.b: "We would like some upgrades to the design..."
 holnavy.5.b.tt: "§YGrants a stronger but more expensive cruiser variant of the current tech level.§!"

 holnavy.6.t: "Pantserschip Design"
 holnavy.6.d: "The old armoured cruisers of the Koningin-Regentes class being way too outdated to be of any use to the navy anymore, these ships are to be scrapped or converted to another use. However, the idea of having compact, relatively affordable ships which still can pack a punch is a compelling one.\n\nWith advances in technology, the biggest drawback of a design like this is negated, its relatively slow speed. We can therefore opt for a more well-rounded design, or we can alter the design and choose for a slower but more heavily armed coastal defence ship.\n\nWe can also do the opposite and opt for a lighter version with reduced armament with some extra anti-aircraft capabilities which might prove useful if they are to be used in the East Indies."
 holnavy.6.a: "We'll opt for a well-rounded design."
 holnavy.6.a.tt: "§YGrants a balanced Battlecruiser variant.§!\n"
 holnavy.6.b: "Make her suitable for coastal defence duties."
 holnavy.6.b.tt: "§YGrants a heavily armed but slow Battlecruiser variant.§!\n"
 holnavy.6.c: "Forgo some artillery in favour of AA guns and more speed."
 holnavy.6.c.tt: "§YGrants an Battlecruiser variant of the current tech level with strong anti-aircraft capabilities at the cost of some artillery.§!\n"
 holnavy.6.e: "We'll opt for a well-rounded design."

 holnavy.7.t: "Specialised Anti-Aircraft Cruiser design"
 holnavy.7.d: "We need new cruisers for our navy's intended role and anticipation of how naval warfare will evolve. Cruisers are important escort vessels and usually carry a mixture of artillery, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes.\n\nOur single carrier cannot carry many squadrons of fighter planes so we can opt to build cruisers which pack considerably more anti-aircraft guns at the expense of some guns pointing towards the sea, thus allowing for more anti-aircraft screening around our larger ships as well as convoys."
 holnavy.7.a: "Such a simple yet effective idea, proceed!"
 holnavy.7.a.tt: "§YGrants a specialised anti-aircraft cruiser variant of the current tech level.§!\n"
 holnavy.7.b: "We need more guns towards the sea, not pointing at the sky!"
 holnavy.7.b.tt: "§YGrants a research bonus for next standard cruiser design.§!\n"

 holnavy.8.t: "Our Battleships"
 holnavy.8.d: "We currently possess five German built and designed Battleships. Commissioned in the 1920s, though built with largely Weltkrieg era design principles, they are showing their age. With the Japanese navy ever expanding and modernising, we need to look into our battleships.\n\nWe can choose to upgrade the ships with newer guns, improved Anti-Aircraft equipment and improved fire control systems.\n\nOf course, we can also attempt to come up with our own designs, though our technical know-how in building these big ships is limited might prove costly in both time and money."
 holnavy.8.a: "Refit our battleships."
 holnavy.8.a.tt: "§YGrants two upgraded variants of the battleship classes in service, and unlocks a decision to upgrade them.§!\n"
 holnavy.8.b: "Refit our battleships"
 holnavy.8.b.tt: "We shall attempt to come up with our own design..."

 holnavy.9.t: "A New Carrier?"
 holnavy.9.d: "We currently possess one carrier, the HrMs Gouden Leeuw. Although this is no match for any of the major naval powers, she is an important asset of our fleet. We can attempt to bolster her efficiency by making more space the hangars.\n\nContacting German shipyards if they are willing to design one for us is also an opportunity. So we can augment her with a sister ship and greatly improving our naval aviation capabilities.\n\nOr we'll design our own by carefully studying the HrMs Gouden Leeuw, but that might take a while."
 holnavy.9.a: "Upgrade the Gouden Leeuw."
 holnavy.9.a.tt: "§YGrants an upgraded variant of the HrMs Gouden Leeuw, making room for 8 more planes.\nUnlocks a decision to upgrade the ship.§!\n\n"
 holnavy.9.b: "Send requests to German shipbuilders to make a new design."
 holnavy.9.b.tt: "We should hear back from them in a few weeks with preliminary designs."
 holnavy.9.c: "We will design our own!"
 holnavy.9.c.tt: "We shall attempt to come up with our own design..."

 holnavy.15.t: "Destroyer Escorts Design"
 holnavy.15.d: "Effective screen ships are important to protect our vulnerable ships from both the dangers from the skies and lurking under the sea. The Dutch navy has a sizeable number of destroyers, but they are reaching a venerable age. New modern destroyer plans are in progress; however, we can opt to alter our designs to improve their combat effectiveness at some additional cost per ship."
 holnavy.15.a: "Send the design to the shipyards as is."
 holnavy.15.a.tt: "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\n\n"
 holnavy.15.b: "We would like some upgrades to the design..."
 holnavy.15.b.tt: "Boosting the torpedo charge of these ships will allow them to fend off enemy ships."
 holnavy.51.t.bb: "German `Battleship Design Licence Granted!"
 holnavy.51.t.cv: "German Carrier Design Licence Granted!"
 holnavy.51.d.bb: "We can now build these majestic ships for our navy with German assistance in our own shipyards!"
 holnavy.51.d.cv: "We now possess the knowledge to build the latest carriers with some German assistance!"
 holnavy.51.a: "Splendid!"
 holnavy.51.b: "Nice, but shelve it for now!"
 holnavy.51.a.tt: "Adds the ordered ship design type to the building options."

 holnavy.100.t: "Battleship Refitting Completed!"
 holnavy.100.d: "The refitting of our battleships has been completed, and the HrMs Aemillia, Mercurius, Groote Liefde, Willem van Oranje and Sint Mattheus have been outfitted with the latest advancements in fire control systems, an improved Anti Air layout and crucial repairs and refittings done, expending the lifetime of these ships considerably."
 holnavy.100.a: "Wonderful!"

 holnavy.101.t: "The Gouden Leeuw is recommissioned!"
 holnavy.101.d: "After several months of work, our pride of the fleet, the HrMs Gouden Leeuw has been upgraded. With her hangar space optimised to fit as many planes as physically possible alongside an overhaul of the engines ensuring she sails a little bit faster, giving us increased capabilities for relatively little cost."
 holnavy.101.a: "Wonderful!"

### Tasteful flavour ###
 holflavor.1.t: "Central European Time Conversion?"
 holflavor.1.d: "As early as the end of the Weltkrieg there have existed suggestions that the Netherlands, currently operating under Greenwich Mean Time, should move to Central European Standard Time instead.\n\nSince the British Revolution however, these calls became increasingly virulent, as there are no longer any significant trading partners in the timezone. The British and French syndicalist regimes have yet to be diplomatically recognised by the Dutch authorities and Flanders-Wallonia has already moved to Central European time under German pressure.\n\nThis debate has quietly carried on through the 1930s, raging between the camp arguing that the Netherlands should follow Amsterdam's natural timezone and the faction that believes the Netherlands should move to the Kaiserreich's timezone - they are after all our single most important trading partner. While an accord in favour of the latter was finally reached in 1935, being that the first of February 1936 would be one hour longer to put the nation's clocks on par with those of the Reichspakt, the ultimate decision is up to us."
 holflavor.1.a: "Let us go ahead!"
 holflavor.1.b: "GMT seems just fine to me, cancel it!"

 holflavor.2.t: "Opening of the Waalbrug"
 holflavor.2.d: "The ferry over the Waal River was one of the Netherlands' busiest ferries. Recognising its limited capacity, the municipal authorities of Nijmegen started the construction of the Waalbrug in 1931. On the 16th of June 1936, the finished bridge has finally been officially opened by Her Majesty the Queen."
 holflavor.2.a: "Hurrah!"

 holflavor.3.t: "Princess Juliana Announces Engagement!"
 holflavor.3.d: "It has been observed that Crown Princess Juliana had been seeing Prince Bernhard zur Lippe-Biesterfeld, whom she had met at the Winter Olympics earlier this year, but the announcement of her engagement with him over radio still took the nation by surprise. Despite the hardships the people are enduring in these trying times because of the Black Monday Crisis, this comes as a welcome cheer and joy is evident throughout the country."
 holflavor.3.a: "How sweet!"

 holflavor.4.t: "Marriage of Juliana"
 holflavor.4.d: "Today Crown Princess Juliana is marrying her fiancé the Prince Bernhard zur Lippe-Biesterfeld, who renamed himself to 'van Lippe-Biesterfeld' in Dutch style. The announcement alone had provoked a wave of happiness throughout crisis-ridden Netherlands and the ceremony certainly will do no less. The national feast will be sure to distract a bit from the current bad economic circumstances and forms a spot of hope for those in despair at the state of the country!"
 holflavor.4.a: "Congratulations, Juliana!"

 holflavor.5.t: "Solar Eclipse Over the Netherlands"
 holflavor.5.d: "A solar eclipse appeared today over the Netherlands as expected; civilians and scientists alike went outside to look at the Sun that was partially covered by the Moon, with some even taking a drive as far as the French border for an optimal view of the phenomenon."
 holflavor.5.a: "Protect your eyes."

 holflavor.6.t: "Utrecht Central Station Fire"
 holflavor.6.d: "The central station in Utrecht has caught fire, resulting in the destruction of the entire upper floor. An investigation by the authorities has concluded that the tragedy has likely been caused by an electrical failure and thus that it was not the result of foul play. Already the press is demanding an official statement to print in tomorrow's newspapers."
 holflavor.6.a: "Tell the press the truth."
 holflavor.6.b: "Report that the syndicalists did it."
 holflavor.6.c: "Blame reactionary elements."

 holflavor.7.t: "First Großer Preis in Zandvoort"
 holflavor.7.d: "The first Dutch Großer Preis, or Grand Prix, has been held on a street track in the town of Zandvoort today. While it does not count for the European championship, it has stirred up much interest and the mayor of Zandvoort has called for support to build a formal circuit in Zandvoort where an official Großer Preis for the Netherlands can be held - one that does formally count towards the European championship."
 holflavor.7.a: "One day we will build it!"

 holflavor.8.t: "Veluwe Sale"
 holflavor.8.d: "As a result, of the brutal economic crisis, the Kröller-Müller aristocratic family is unable to afford the maintenance of their hunting grounds in the Veluwe. They have announced their intention to sell the hunting ground to a government-supported foundation, if possible. This will make the area open for visitors in what could become the first national park in continental Holland, heavily populated with game such as deer and wild boar, released in the area by Anton Kröller.\n\nThe only condition placed on the deal is that they can continue living in their mansion in the area. Word is that Mrs. Müller even intends to start a museum if the plan is executed."
 holflavor.8.a: "Support the foundation, purchase the grounds."
 holflavor.8.b: "The grounds are sold to a German aristocrat instead."

 holflavor.9.t: "Death of C.J. Snijders"
 holflavor.9.d: "Cornelis Jacobus Snijders, commander of the Dutch armed forces during the Weltkrieg, passed away today. Snijders was controversial in that the liberal cabinet ruling the Netherlands at the time wanted to fire him for defeatism as he believed the Netherlands should not resist a German invasion, a move only prevented by the personal intervention of Queen Wilhelmina. After the Weltkrieg Snijders made himself famous again by co-founding the VNH, that makes up the far right of Dutch politics today."
 holflavor.9.a: "Requiescat in Pace."

 holflavor.10.t: "Birth of Princess Beatrix"
 holflavor.10.d: "Princess Juliana has given birth to the future crown princess of the Netherlands, named Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard van Oranje-Nassau, who shall inherit the Dutch throne after her mother dies or abdicates. It is a great relief to the Dutch monarchy that an heir has been born as it will prevent a succession crisis in the future, and many people are already publicly proclaiming their congratulations for the Queen."
 holflavor.10.a: "Hurrah!"

 holflavor.11.t: "Landdag of the VNH"
 holflavor.11.d: "The VNH has held its first annual landdag since gaining power in the Dutch nation. Party members from across the country have come together in Rotterdam to celebrate this joyous occasion. Cornelis van Geelkerken has held a rousing speech, after which the festivities began.\n\nAccording to Van Geelkerken, the national Jeugdstorm, the youth league of the VNH was exceptionally important in turning the tide and giving the VNH the chance to change the country around, but he warned that no regime is safe until syndicalism has been thoroughly rooted out. Interestingly, he failed to mention the VNH old guard entirely, exposing tensions between the old and the new guard, experts say."
 holflavor.11.a: "Houzee! Houzee! Houzee!"

 holflavor.12.t: "Queen's Day"
 holflavor.12.d: "It is the Queen's birthday and thus the national holiday 'Koninginnedag'. People across the country are celebrating the monarchy, but surely also what it means to be Dutch. As usual, Queen Wilhelmina and the rest of the Royal family are not taking part in public festivities, due to the need to maintain their Royal dignity. Still, thousands of well-wishers are gathered outside Soestdijk palace with flags crying out with joy."
 holflavor.12.a: "Hiep hiep, hoera!"

 holflavor.13.t: "Dissident Queen's Day"
 holflavor.13.d: "Before the revolution, this would have been Queen's Day, the birthday of the Queen. As a result, reactionaries and other royalist scum are causing all kinds of trouble, ranging from openly celebrating the Queen's birthday to actual riots and demonstrations in favour of the restoration of the monarchy."
 holflavor.13.a: "Let the Red Front shut this abomination down!"

 holflavor.14.t: "Queen's Day"
 holflavor.14.d: "Today is the birthday of Queen Juliana and thus the first new Queen's Day. People across the country are celebrating the monarchy, and surely also the Dutch spirit. The children in any case are bound to approve; our former Queen's day fell in the summer holiday, but now they get an additional day off during the school term.\n\nThe date is not the only thing that is different this year, as contrary to Wilhelmina Queen Juliana has scheduled a public appearance on her Queen's Day: today she accepted a floral tribute, as her grandmother the Queen-Consort-Regentess, Emma always did."
 holflavor.14.a: "Hiep hiep, hoera!"

 holflavor.15.t: "Queen's Day"
 holflavor.15.d: "It is the Queen's birthday and thus the national holiday 'Koninginnedag. People across the country are celebrating the monarchy, but surely also what it means to be Dutch.\n\nQueen Juliana publicly received her floral tribute, as usual, at Soestdijk palace."
 holflavor.15.a: "Hiep hiep, Hoera!"

 holflavor.16.t: "May Day"
 holflavor.16.d: "While May Day or labour day never became very popular in the Netherlands, with the ascension of a new socialist government, we need an alternative holiday to replace the popular but now defunct 'Koninginnedag'. While today's first celebration appears to have attracted merely some hard-line syndicalists, there have been some moderates as well, so we have high hopes that next year will be a full-scale celebration. One blemish on the day was that we were forced to move the planned annual pensionary speech in Amsterdam to Groningen for security reasons."
 holflavor.16.a: "This first one wasn't a success..."

 holflavor.17.t: "May Day"
 holflavor.17.d: "It is the first of May again, and thus once again it is Labour Day. People across the country have the day off to celebrate the revolution and the gains it brought. [HOL.GetLeader] had held the annual pensionary speech today in Amsterdam while people were dressed in red, after which a school class was given the honour of singing the international, which was transmitted over radio to the entire country!"
 holflavor.17.a: "Breek uw ketens!"

 holflavor.18.t: "Independence Day"
 holflavor.18.d: "Following the abolishment of the monarchy, the government had to find an alternative festivity to replace the previously popular Queen's Day. A liberal representative started a motion to make the signing of the Plakkaat van Verlaetinghe, the Independence Day of the United Provinces, into a national holiday.\n\nEagerly accepted, it has proven to be a great success: based on patriotism, it inspires not only republicans around the country, but VNH members and even some royalists see the merit of this celebration. It seems we have found an ideal alternative."
 holflavor.18.a: "Wilhelmus... oh no, wait, that's abolished!"

 holflavor.19.t: "Independence Day"
 holflavor.19.d: "It is independence day again, and thus the national holiday of the Dutch republic. People across the country are celebrating the existence of our nation, but surely also what it means to be Dutch.\n\nPensionary [HOL.GetLeader] held a speech over radio and clubs preparing the festivities for their own municipalities are finally unfolding the activities they have been organising for school kids."
 holflavor.19.a: "Long live the Netherlands."

 hol_join_reichspakt_decision: "Join the Reichspakt"
 hol_join_reichspakt_decision_desc: "Germany has steadfastly remained our best partner. With the dangers of international syndicalism on the horizon, it would be delusional to think the Netherlands could stay out of any future conflict and not at best be invaded right after. We should formally abandon our policy of neutrality and strike an alliance with the Germans."
 hol_join_internationale_decision: "Beitritt zur Internationale"
 hol_join_internationale_decision_desc: "Now that a worker's state has come to fruition in our nation, it is time for us to formally join the international class struggle by joining the military side of the Third Internationale. The Batavian Commune shall do its part in the struggle against capitalism!"
 hol_formulate_policy_belgium: "Formulate a policy on Belgium"
 hol_formulate_policy_belgium_desc: "We ought to formulate a policy on our southern neighbour: relations between the Netherlands and Belgium have historically been rocky at best since the nation seceded from our own. Is it time to open a new chapter on Belgo-Dutch relations or is it time to undo the mistakes made in the 19th century?"
 hol_research_agreement_belgium_decision: "Research Agreement with [BEL.GetNameDef]"

Cooperation between our nations has been more than once proposed by both Dutch and Afrikaner - offspring of Dutch colonists in South Africa - intellectuals, and some of them like general James Hertzog have even studied here in the Netherlands. Perhaps we can leverage this situation to increase the scientific cooperation between our countries."

 hol_emancipate_the_colonies_desc: "The time of an unequal relationship between the fatherland and the colonies has passed.
