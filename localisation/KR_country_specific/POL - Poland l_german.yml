 POL_totalist_party_long: "Komunistyczna Partia Robotnicza Polski (Polnische Kommunistische Arbeiterpartei)\n§gDie KPRP wurde im Gefolge der Russischen Revolution von polnischen Kommunisten gegründet, ihre Blütezeit war jedoch nur kurz.

Die ZZZ ist ein Versuch, die verschiedenen syndikalistisch gesinnten Gruppen unter der Führung des Vorsitzenden Kazimierz Zakrzewski zu vereinen.

Die Radikalen der Endecja unter Roman Dmowski sind in Polen nicht willkommen, und ihre Führung wird nach Moskau verbannt.

 POL_market_liberal2_party_long: "Polskie Centrum (Polnisches Zentrum)\n§gDas Zentrum ist eine kleine konservativ-liberale Partei, die sich hauptsächlich aus früheren Monarchisten und den gemäßigten Mitgliedern der MKP zusammensetzt, die sich nicht aus der Politik zurückgezogen haben.

 POL_paternal_autocrat2_party_long: "Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego (Lager der nationalen Einheit)\n§gDie OZN ist im Wesentlichen ein politischer Arm der Militärclique von Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Sie präsentiert sich als unpolitische Organisation, die alle politischen Gruppierungen in Polen unter einem Banner vereinen will. In der Praxis ist ihr politisches Programm fast eine Kopie der Bewegung der Nationaldemokratie, die sich hauptsächlich aus Militarismus, Nationalismus und Antisemitismus zusammensetzt.§!"
 POL_national_populist2_party: "SN"
 POL_national_populist2_party_long: "Stronnictwo Narodowe (Nationale Partei)\n§gNachdem die nationaldemokratische Bewegung sich wieder offen organisieren durfte, gründeten die Anhänger von Roman Dmowski die Nationale Partei als ihren politischen Arm. Während die Bewegung auf dem Papier lediglich christlich-konservativ ist, ist die Partei in der Praxis sehr radikal. Da die meisten der gemäßigten Nationaldemokraten in der ChZJN engagiert sind, ist die Nationale Partei mit denjenigen gefüllt, die früher verboten wurden - Rechtsradikale um Adam Doboszyński und Hardcore-Endeks, die keine Liebe für das demokratische System haben.§!"
 POL_national_populist3_party: "ON"
 POL_national_populist3_party_long: "Organizacja Narodowa (Nationale Organisation)\n§gIn Adam Doboszyńskis Theorie der Nation ist das Mehrparteiensystem ein Gräuel für die nationale Einheit. Stattdessen sollte die Elite in einer einzigen politischen Organisation vereint sein, die in der Lage ist, die gesamte Gesellschaft gemäß den christlichen und distributiven Lehren zu koordinieren. Diese Gruppe tugendhafter Männer wird als Lehrer und Organisatoren des Volkes fungieren und dafür sorgen, dass die politische Hygiene der Massen entwickelt wird.§!"

 POL_august_iv_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g29. Januar 1887, Potsdam, Deutsches Kaiserreich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gDer als August Wilhelm Heinrich Günther Viktor von Preußen geborene August IV. aus dem Hause Hohenzollern wurde 1921 im Silberornat von August III. zum König von Polen gekrönt. Als Prinz in Deutschland wurde er von seinem Vater, Kaiser Wilhelm II., für seine Vorliebe für Schmuck und für die Gesellschaft von Künstlern in seiner Potsdamer Villa kritisiert. Als König von Polen hat er in den letzten fünfzehn Jahren versucht, gut zu regieren, obwohl seine Regentschaft von Vorwürfen wegen seines verweichlichten Auftretens und seiner angespannten Beziehung zu seiner Frau überschattet wurde, was ihm in einem zutiefst konservativen, katholischen Land nicht gut bekam.\n\nAuf politischer Ebene war er gezwungen, mehr Macht an den Sejm abzugeben, und wurde zu einem echten konstitutionellen Monarchen, dessen Funktionen weitgehend zeremoniell sind und dessen Prärogative weitgehend von seinem Premierminister ausgeübt werden. Das unglückliche Schicksal König Augusts besteht darin, dass er scheinbar von allen Seiten missbilligt wird: Für die Nationalisten ist er ein Symbol der unerträglichen deutschen Vorherrschaft, für die Pragmatiker ein notwendiges Übel und für den Kaiser ist er sein unbeliebtester Sohn."
 POL_aleksander_ii_advisor_desc: "§YBerater Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g26. Dezember 1912, Berlin, Deutsches Kaiserreich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gPrinz Alexander Ferdinand war erst acht Jahre alt, als seine Familie nach Polen zog. Seine Jugend war überschattet von der recht distanzierten und schwierigen Beziehung seiner Eltern und dem Erwartungsdruck, der auf ihm lastete: Er sollte schließlich den polnischen Thron besteigen. Alexander schlug eine militärische Laufbahn ein, wie sie für einen deutschen Adeligen typisch ist. Obwohl er in der polnischen Kultur und Sprache ausgebildet wurde, bleibt er darin bestenfalls mittelmäßig. Das hindert ihn jedoch nicht daran, das beliebteste Mitglied des polnischen Königshauses zu sein, und es wird allgemein gehofft, dass er eines Tages eine Polin heiraten wird."
 POL_aleksander_ii_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g26. Dezember 1912, Berlin, Deutsches Kaiserreich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gKönig Aleksander II., geboren als Alexander Ferdinand, war erst acht Jahre alt, als seine Familie nach Polen zog. Seine Jugend war überschattet von der recht distanzierten und schwierigen Beziehung seiner Eltern und dem Erwartungsdruck, der auf ihm lastete: Er sollte schließlich den polnischen Thron besteigen. Alexander schlug eine militärische Laufbahn ein, wie sie für einen deutschen Aristokraten typisch ist. Sein Dienst in der polnischen Luftwaffe brachte ihm viel Ruhm und Bewunderung in der polnischen Öffentlichkeit ein, und in vielerlei Hinsicht haben die gemeinsamen Kriegswirren dazu geführt, dass er in Polen weitaus akzeptierter ist als sein Vater es je war. Seine Heirat mit Maria Bnińska im Jahr 1939 hat ihm dabei sehr geholfen, denn die polnische Königin hat die gesamte Monarchie viel polnischer werden lassen. Allerdings ist Aleksander in der Politik unerprobt, und man kann nur vermuten, wie gut er als Führer in Friedenszeiten sein wird."
 POL_kazimierz_zakrzewski_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g4. November 1900, Krakau, Österreichisches Kaiserreich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gKazimierz Zakrzewski, vielleicht der führende Visionär der polnischen Linken, hat einen weiten Weg aus den Krakauer Vorstädten nach Paris und wieder zurück nach Polen zurückgelegt. Der 1900 geborene Kazimierz Zakrzewski begann eine akademische Laufbahn in den Fußstapfen seines Vaters. Sein Studium wurde jäh unterbrochen, als der junge idealistische Student der Antike in die Polnischen Legionen eintrat und die Hoffnung hegte, sein Land vom zaristischen Joch zu befreien. Wie viele andere Legionäre war auch Zakrzewski nach dem Krieg vom neuen Königreich Polen enttäuscht, das von vielen nur als deutsches Marionettenregime betrachtet wurde. In dieser Zeit interessierte er sich für die Philosophie sozialistischer Denker wie Sorel, Jouhaux und Brzozowski und schloss sich radikalen \"Zetisten\" an, die Patriotismus und soziale Revolution miteinander verbinden wollten. Nach seinem Abschluss im Jahr 1923 beschloss er, nach Frankreich zu gehen. Nicht nur, um die Antike zu studieren, sondern - was vielleicht noch wichtiger war - um die Revolution zu studieren.\n\nAus einem bloßen Besuch wurden Jahre, denn Dr. Zakrzewski schloss sich der Patriotischen Union an, einer syndikalistischen Organisation, die sich aus polnischen Exilanten und Emigranten zusammensetzte. Der brillante junge Historiker wurde schnell zu einem einflussreichen Namen in Frankreich und veröffentlichte unermüdlich sowohl syndikalistische Texte (unter dem Pseudonym Nostromo) als auch Geschichten über Byzanz. Innerhalb eines Jahrzehnts festigte er seinen Platz als Vorsitzender des gesamten Polnischen Revolutionskomitees, wurde aber auch zu einem vertrauenswürdigen Verbündeten von Jacques Doriots Clique der Sorelianer und zu einem Wortführer des \"revolutionären Nationalismus\".\n\nIn seinen Jahren im Exil hat Zakrzewski seine eigene syndikalistische Theorie entwickelt, die den Marxismus und den Anarcho-Syndikalismus ablehnt und stattdessen die Nation als natürliche, proletarische Kraft verehrt, die den vereinten Willen der schöpferischen Kraft des Proletariats symbolisiert. Sein Ideal einer \"organischen Arbeitsdemokratie\" wäre ein Staat, der von einem starken, demokratisch gewählten Führer geführt wird, und eine Arbeiterelite, die von den Gewerkschaften geführt wird und durch die Wachsamkeit des Arbeitersoldaten geschützt wird."
 POL_leah_feldman_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §gSeptember, 1898, Odessa, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gLeah Feldman ist eine wirklich bemerkenswerte Frau - sie hat russische, französische und britische Revolutionen miterlebt, mit Nestor Makhno gegen die Kosaken gekämpft und jüdische Widerstandsbewegungen in Palästina organisiert. Selbst ihr Geburtsort ist nicht sicher bekannt - sie gibt Warschau an, während in ihrem britischen Pass Odessa steht. Bekannt ist jedoch, dass sie in einer armen polnisch-jüdischen Emigrantenfamilie in London aufwuchs und sich schon früh in der lokalen anarchistischen Bewegung engagierte. Im Jahr 1918 segelte sie nach Petrograd, um die Geburt der ersten wirklich sozialistischen Nation mitzuerleben, war aber schnell von der Brutalität der Bolschewiki entsetzt und beschloss stattdessen, sich den Truppen von Nestor Makhno anzuschließen - und kämpfte sowohl gegen die Roten als auch gegen die Weißen, bis die Anarchisten besiegt und zur Flucht gezwungen wurden.\n\nFeldman landete in der jungen französischen Kommune und schloss sich Lew Mareks Gruppe polnischer Anarcho-Syndikalisten an. In diesen Jahren interessierte sie sich wirklich für die Sache Polens und war nach Dr. Zakrzewski, mit dem sie in fast allen Punkten nicht übereinstimmte, eines der aktivsten Mitglieder des Polnischen Revolutionskomitees. Im Gegensatz zu Zakrzewski unternahm Feldman viele Reisen, schloss sich der britischen Revolution an und setzte sich später in Palästina für die Freiheit der Juden ein. \"Die Makhnovistische Oma\", wie sie liebevoll genannt wurde, ist wirklich eine professionelle, internationale Revolutionärin - eine mit strahlenden Idealen und wenig Geduld für Kompromisse. Mit der Revolution in Polen steht sie vor ihrer bisher schwierigsten Aufgabe: Sie muss die junge syndikalistische Nation durch den Krieg und die inneren Kämpfe zur wahren Freiheit führen und darf sie nicht den autoritären Ambitionen Zakrzewskis überlassen."
 POL_jerzy_cseszejko_sochacki_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g29. November 1892, Nieżyn, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gJerzy Czeszejko-Sochacki studierte in St. Petersburg und war bereits während des Ersten Weltkriegs eng mit den russischen, litauischen und polnischen kommunistischen Bewegungen verbunden. Nach dem Zusammenbruch der Bolschewiki wurde seine Partei - wie der Großteil der polnischen Linken - in den Untergrund gedrängt, und Czeszejko-Sochacki ging nach Frankreich ins Exil. Dort fand er in den Lehren von Marcel Cachin und dem französischen Rätekonzept für die Revolution eine neue ideologische Grundlage. In Polen stand Czeszejko-Sochacki etwas außerhalb des Machtkampfes um Zakrzewski."
 POL_zygmunt_zaremba_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g28. April 1895, Piotrków, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gZygmunt Zaremba trat der Polnischen Sozialistischen Partei in sehr jungen Jahren bei, und zwar aus ähnlichen Gründen wie viele andere - um die Sache der polnischen Unabhängigkeit zu unterstützen, wie es seine Familie eine Generation zuvor im Januaraufstand getan hatte. Zaremba war ein aktiver Studentenorganisator und das jüngste Mitglied, das in das Zentrale Arbeiterkomitee der PPS gewählt wurde. Er war jedoch weder ein Anhänger von Piłsudski, noch sah er in der Zusammenarbeit mit den Deutschen einen Ausweg. Ganz im Gegenteil, er lehnte jede Art von Koalitionsverhandlungen oder Zusammenarbeit mit der Monarchie in Polen entschieden ab. Sein Glaube an eine kompromisslose Arbeiterdemokratie scheint unumstößlich zu sein, und diese Haltung hat ihn mehrfach ins Gefängnis gebracht. Seit seiner letzten Entlassung operiert er von Galizien aus und stellt zusammen mit seiner ukrainischen Frau Natalia Verbindungen zwischen polnischen und ukrainischen sozialistischen Unabhängigkeitsaktivisten her. Im Gegensatz zu Kazimierz Zakrzewski und der Führung der ZZZ in Frankreich hat Zaremba nie daran geglaubt, dass die polnische Befreiung von einer anderen Quelle als den Polen - und ihren Brüdern in den Nachbarländern - ausgehen könnte."
 POL_norbert_barlicki_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g6. Juni 1880, Sieciechów, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gNorbert Barlicki erlangte 1918 nationale Berühmtheit, als er sich vehement gegen den Vertrag von Brest aussprach und dem Staatsrat die Erklärung über freie Wahlen vorlas. Dafür wurde er in der Festung Modlin inhaftiert, aus der er erst nach Kriegsende entlassen wurde. Seine radikalsten sozialistischen Positionen milderten sich danach ziemlich ab. Anstelle der sozialistischen Hardliner-Linie, an die viele in seiner Partei glaubten, war Barlicki ein Mann der Einheitsfront. Ob Idealismus oder Pragmatismus, er glaubte, dass der beste Weg, dem polnischen Volk zu helfen, innerhalb des Systems lag, durch unermüdliche Arbeit an der Basis, um die Lebensbedingungen der Menschen zu verbessern. Zu diesem Zweck pflegte er enge Beziehungen zur Volkspartei, der er bereits seit der Gründung der PSL angehörte.\n\nDiese Zusammenarbeit trug schließlich Früchte, als der große alte Mann der PSL, Tomasz Nocznicki, in den 1930er Jahren Premierminister wurde und Barlicki als Kabinettsmitglied fungierte. Viele Reformen und der weithin erfolgreiche Vierjahresplan wurden als Beweis dafür angesehen, dass die von Deutschland auferlegte Monarchie den Interessen des einfachen Volkes dienen konnte - und selbst wenn die Regierung schließlich fiel, gab sie dem derzeitigen Bündnis aus PPS und PSL ein sehr konkretes Ziel.\n\nBarlickis Optimismus war unbegründet, denn nach den chaotischen Wahlen von 1938 wurde dem Zentrum-Block trotz seines Sieges die Bildung einer Regierung verweigert. Da Barlicki keine andere Möglichkeit sah, gab er schließlich den Radikalen des Blocks nach, und die Proteste schlugen in eine Revolution um, in deren Verlauf die Monarchie gestürzt und die Republik ausgerufen wurde. Wie es das Schicksal wollte, wurde der einzige Mann, der an die Rettung der Monarchie glaubte, der erste Führer der Republik. Norbert Barlicki konnte ein Bündnis zwischen den Arbeitern und den Bauern schmieden, die den König stürzten, jetzt muss er die Front zusammenhalten."
 POL_stanislaw_wojciechowski_leader_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g15. März 1869, Kalisz, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gStanisław Wojciechowski wurde in einer bürgerlichen Familie in einem Vorort von Kalisz geboren und begann wie viele seiner Landsleute seine Radikalisierung während des Studiums. Er nahm 1892 am Gründungskongress der Polnischen Sozialistischen Partei in Paris teil und war ein aktiver Gewerkschaftsorganisator, der oft mit der Polizei in Konflikt geriet. Die französischen Behörden wiesen ihn aus, und Wojciechowski kehrte in das Königreich Polen zurück, wo er sich in den Aktivismus stürzte. Er arbeitete eng mit Józef Piłsudski und der PPS zusammen, unterhielt aber auch Kontakte zu den Nationaldemokraten, da er der Meinung war, dass das gesamte politische Establishment Polens für die Unabhängigkeit benötigt wird.\n\nNach 1905 begann Wojciechowski, sich von politischen Parteien und Gewerkschaften zu distanzieren, und konzentrierte sich stattdessen auf landwirtschaftliche Genossenschaften als Grundlage der polnischen Freiheit und versuchte, das Leben auf dem Land zu verbessern. Diese Bemühungen wurden durch den Ersten Weltkrieg unterbrochen. Wojciechowski evakuierte sich mit dem Nationalkomitee nach Russland und versuchte erneut, ein Bündnis mit den Nationaldemokraten zu schmieden, jedoch mit wenig Erfolg. Enttäuscht kehrte er 1918 mit seiner Familie in das Königreich Polen zurück und konzentrierte sich auf die sozialen Aktivitäten und die Nahrungsmittelhilfe im kriegszerstörten Königreich. In den 1920er Jahren trat er der PSL bei und wurde Universitätsdozent. In seinen Vorlesungen betonte er stets die Bedeutung der wirtschaftlichen Demokratisierung als Vorstufe zur politischen Demokratisierung und vertrat die Ansicht, dass Polen keine echte Demokratie sein könne, solange das Königreich von Kapitalisten und Großgrundbesitzern dominiert werde. Als langjähriger Senator, Landwirtschaftsminister im Kabinett Nocznicki und Vorsitzender des Genossenschaftsverbandes ist Wojciechowski ein angesehener und erfahrener Politiker und sozialer Aktivist. Obwohl er zunächst zögerte, das Präsidentenamt anzunehmen, wurde er durch die parteiübergreifende Unterstützung des Sejm davon überzeugt, für eine Amtszeit zu kandidieren - nur um die kritischen ersten Jahre der jungen Republik zu sichern - und sich dann aus der Politik zurückzuziehen."
 POL_jan_woznicki_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g15. August 1881, Nieszawa, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gJan Woźnicki ist Teil des rechten Flügels der PSL. Er wurde 1904 im Rahmen des Kampfes gegen die Russifizierung des Bildungswesens Mitglied der Nationaldemokraten. Er wurde 1906 von den zaristischen Behörden inhaftiert, weil er seine Position als Lehrer nutzte, um Widerstand zu organisieren, und verließ bald darauf die Nationaldemokraten, da er von Roman Dmowskis friedlicher Haltung und seinem Prinzip des gewaltlosen Widerstands enttäuscht war.\n\nStattdessen trat Woźnicki in die Polnischen Legionen und bald darauf in die PSL ein. Er war mehrfach Mitglied des Sejm, wobei er sich vor allem auf Programme zur Bildung und Korruptionsbekämpfung konzentrierte. In den vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnten hat er sich auf beiden Seiten des politischen Spektrums als verlässlicher Vertreter der Mitte einen Namen gemacht."
 POL_gabriel_narutowicz_desc: "§YAnführer Beschreibung\nGeboren: §g29. März 1865, Telsze, Russisches Reich\n§YPolitische Karriere: §gGabriel Narutowicz wurde in einem samogitischen Dorf in Litauen geboren. Sein Vater war ein fortschrittlicher Großgrundbesitzer, der die Leibeigenschaft auf seinem Land abgeschafft hatte, und seine Mutter war eine Gelehrte der Aufklärung. Diese Erziehung gab Gabriel und seinem Bruder Stanisław eine starke national-progressive Philosophie. Während sein Bruder in Litauen blieb, musste Gabriel vor den zaristischen Behörden fliehen und absolvierte in der Schweiz ein Ingenieurstudium.

Nach der Angliederung der Provinz Posen an Polen wurde Mikołajczyk mit starker Unterstützung aus seiner Heimatregion in den nationalen Sejm gewählt.

Zunächst schien es nicht naheliegend, dass er einer der produktivsten polnischen rechtsextremen Theoretiker werden würde - seine Jugend verlief relativ normal, und er war während des Ersten Weltkriegs noch ein Kind. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters im Jahr 1929 übernahm Adam das Familiengut in der Nähe von Krakau. Während dieser Zeit begann er zu schreiben.\n\nDie Krise der Creditanstalt im Jahr 1931 erschütterte ganz Österreich-Ungarn und veranlasste Doboszyński, sich der nationaldemokratischen Bewegung sowohl in Polen als auch in Galizien anzuschließen, da er mit den Zuständen in beiden Ländern zunehmend unzufrieden war. Doboszyński reiste viel und ließ sich von Theoretikern des Distributivismus, wie Gilbert Chesterton, und der größeren Bewegung der katholischen Soziallehre stark inspirieren. Doboszyński wurde zu einem eigenständigen politischen Theoretiker, der begann, den polnischen Nationalismus mit der Sozialwissenschaft der katholischen Kirche zu verbinden. Er nutzte das relativ liberale Verlagsrecht in Galizien, um ein produktiver Autor zu werden, und seine Texte wurden auf beiden Seiten der Grenze weit verbreitet. Doboszyński kritisierte sowohl den Kapitalismus als auch den Sozialismus als Strukturen, die den menschlichen Geist zermalmen, und forderte ein geistiges Erwachen der polnischen Bevölkerung. Viele sagen, er habe den deutschen Wirtschaftszusammenbruch von 1936 richtig vorausgesagt.\n\nBis 1936 war Doboszyński zum Organisator und Redner der Nationaldemokraten geworden. Er bereiste das polnische Land und agitierte gegen die ausländischen Monarchen, die über die Polen herrschten, gegen die Freimaurer und Juden, die die polnische Gesellschaft kontrollierten, gegen die Sozialisten und Liberalen, die das Wohl Polens nicht verstanden. Trotz zahlreicher Zusammenstöße mit der Polizei und Zeiten der Untergrundtätigkeit wuchs Doboszyńskis Ruhm und erreichte seinen Höhepunkt, als er einen Überfall auf Myślenice anführte und mit seiner Miliz gegen die jüdische Bevölkerung der Stadt vorging. Nach einer kurzen Zeit im Gefängnis floh er nach Russland in die Exilführung der Nationalen Liga und wurde nach Dmowskis Tod zum Führer der nationaldemokratischen Bewegung.\n\nAn der Macht ist Doboszyński endlich in der Lage, seine Theorien in die Praxis umzusetzen. In seiner Vision ist die ideale Gesellschaft die der Zeit vor der Aufklärung, in der die Industrialisierung noch nicht die Gier und Lust des Menschen freigesetzt hatte und in der eine starke Familie und die Kirche den Menschen ein sinnvolles und moralisches soziales Umfeld boten. Er ist davon überzeugt, dass dieses vergangene goldene Zeitalter der Menschheit durch unermüdliche Arbeit zurückgebracht werden kann."

Er war gezwungen, nach Krakau zu ziehen, um der russischen Polizei zu entgehen, und lernte dort Józef Piłsudski kennen, den er wie viele andere zukünftige Legionäre vergötterte. Er setzte den Kampf in der PPS-Kampforganisation fort, war Mitbegründer der Schützenvereinigung und beendete in der Zwischenzeit sein Architekturstudium.\n\nWährend des Krieges wurde Sosnkowski Piłsudskis rechte Hand und erwies sich als brillanter und kühler Feldherr. Während der Eideskrise wurde er zusammen mit Piłsudski und Slawek verhaftet und verbrachte den Rest des Krieges im Gefängnis. Während seiner Gefangenschaft spielte er über 500 Partien Schach mit Piłsudski und entwickelte eine Leidenschaft für dieses Spiel. Nach dem Krieg gab er sein politisches Engagement für einige Zeit auf und konzentrierte sich stattdessen auf die Musik.\n\nSosnkowski durfte in den späten 1920er Jahren zur Armee zurückkehren, wurde aber aufgrund seiner engen Freundschaft mit Piłsudski an den Rand gedrängt. Er war zu fähig, um lange in niederen Diensten zu bleiben, und diente schließlich in mehreren Militärdelegationen und anderen organisatorischen Aufgaben. Er sprach fließend Deutsch, Französisch, Englisch, Italienisch, Russisch und Griechisch.\n§YAnmerkungen: Er wird verdächtigt, Sympathien für die Republikaner zu hegen, ist aber offiziell unpolitisch.§!"

Bei Ausbruch des Weltkriegs war er bereits Leutnant und diente als Nachrichtenoffizier in der Signalabteilung der 4.Armee. Guderian kämpfte in Verdun und Italien und war bei Kriegsende in Polen stationiert.\n\nHätte er nicht den berühmten Panzerkommandanten des Weltkriegs, Ernst Volckheim, kennen gelernt, wäre Guderian vielleicht den traditionellen preußischen Weg weitergegangen. Doch Volckheims umstrittene Ideen über den Vorrang gepanzerter Einheiten inspirierten Guderian sehr. In den 1920er Jahren wurde er zu einem profunden Kenner der gepanzerten Kriegsführung und verfolgte aufmerksam die aufkommenden französischen Theorien des \"guerre de mouvement\" (Bewegungskrieg). Sein hartnäckiges Beharren auf der neuen Doktrin und sein beißender Sarkasmus machten ihn jedoch im deutschen Generalstab nicht sehr beliebt, und 1927 wurde er zum Militärattaché von König August IV. \"befördert\" und mit der Überwachung und Ausbildung der polnischen Wehrmacht zu einer modernen Kampftruppe betraut.\n\nObwohl er de facto ins polnische Exil verbannt war und keine Karriere machen konnte, beschloss Guderian, seine Theorien in der polnischen Armee in die Praxis umzusetzen. Er scharte eine Clique gleichgesinnter Offiziere wie Oswald Lutz und sogar einige Polen wie Władysław Anders um sich. Vor allem aber gelang es Guderian, die polnische Regierung davon zu überzeugen, seine Vision vom Krieg der Zukunft zu unterstützen - zweifellos sah er in einer kleinen Elitearmee eine Option, die sich langfristig als billiger und populärer erweisen würde als die Masseneinberufung. Bis 1936 arbeitete Guderian unermüdlich mit seinen Panzerdivisionen an der Modernisierung der polnischen Armee und ihrer Doktrin für jeden künftigen Krieg."

Während dieser Zeit engagierte er sich in verschiedenen Organisationen wie den sozialistischen Paramilitärs, die für die Unabhängigkeit Polens kämpften. Er lernte auch Piłsudski, Slawek, Sosnkowski und andere Aktivisten kennen und wurde Vorsitzender der Lwówer Ortsgruppe des Schützenbundes.\n\nBei Ausbruch des Weltkriegs wurde Sikorski mobilisiert und kämpfte in den polnischen Einheiten des österreichisch-ungarischen Militärs. Schließlich schloss er sich Piłsudskis polnischen Legionen an und fungierte als Rekrutierer in Krakau. In dieser Zeit entfernte er sich von Piłsudski, der für eine gemeinsame Sache mit den Mittelmächten gegen Russland eintrat, während Sikorski glaubte, dass sowohl die Österreicher als auch die Deutschen das polnische Volk verraten hatten. Ironischerweise wurden Sikorskis Zweifel bestätigt, als die Schwurkrise zur Auflösung der polnischen Legionen führte. Sikorski selbst kehrte in die österreichisch-ungarische Armee zurück, schloss sich aber bald Piłsudski in der Internierung an, nachdem er seinem Landsmann lauwarme Solidarität bekundet hatte.\n\nDa er sich weigerte, unter einem anderen deutschen König zu dienen, beschloss Władysław Sikorski, nach dem Krieg in Galizien zu bleiben. Er trat wieder in die Armee ein und wurde zu einem bekannten Militärtheoretiker, der die Modernisierung und Motorisierung der galizischen Streitkräfte forderte. Sikorski war auch in der Politik aktiv und setzte sich für die Demokratie und die Vereinigung der \"zwei Polen\" auf beiden Seiten der Grenze ein."

Er schloss sich der Nationalen Arbeitergewerkschaft an, einer Pro-Endecja-Partei, und radikalisierte sich während seines Studiums in Krakau weiter. Obwohl er Władysław Studnicki als seinen Mentor betrachtete, trat Koc trotz dessen sozialistischer Ausrichtung der Union des aktiven Kampfes bei. Er lernte Józef Piłsudski und die anderen berühmten Legionäre kennen und wurde schließlich Slaweks Stellvertreter in der Polnischen Militärorganisation, wo er Partisanenaktionen hinter den Linien im russischen Teil Polens organisierte.\n\nAls der Krieg weiterging, wollte Koc unbedingt an die Front gelangen. Da es unmöglich war, das Niemandsland zu durchqueren, reiste er illegal durch Finnland, und nach mehreren unerwarteten Problemen gelangte er in Piłsudskis Hauptquartier und trat offiziell der Legion bei. Schließlich nahm er an der Besetzung von Lublin teil, doch nachdem er wegen seiner Beteiligung an nationalistischer Agitation unter den Lubliner Polen erwischt worden war, wurde er trotz seiner schlechten Sehkraft an die Front geschickt.

Unzählige junge Offiziere lernten sein explosives Temperament während seiner langen Karriere bei der Ausbildung der neuen Soldatengeneration zu fürchten. Berbeckis persönliche Ansichten sind immer noch sehr stark von Piłsudski geprägt, obwohl er argumentiert hat, dass die Eid-Krise nicht als Piłsudskis prägender Faktor angesehen werden sollte, sondern vielmehr seine Überzeugung, dass Polen nur in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Mächten sicher sein kann und dass letztlich Russland der existenzielle Feind ist, nicht Deutschland."

Oktober 1867, Garbów, Russisches Reich\n§YMilitärische Karriere: §gDie Wurzeln von Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki gehen auf eine kalvinistische litauische Familie zurück, die sich im 17. Jahrhundert in Sandomierz niederließ. Er diente dreißig Jahre lang in der russischen Armee, wo er im Fernen Osten und im Großen Krieg eingesetzt wurde. Bis 1917 war er Generalleutnant und wurde zum Oberbefehlshaber der polnischen Streitkräfte in Russland ernannt, mit dem Ziel, die polnischen Soldaten in ihren eigenen nationalen Einheiten zu organisieren. Das polnische Korps in Russland verfügte über rund 64.000 Mann und machte Dowbor-Muśnicki zu einem wichtigen Kriegsherrn in der sich ständig verändernden politischen Situation Russlands, wo die Polen zunächst mit der Regierung von Alexander Kerenski zusammenarbeiteten, da diese den russischen Minderheiten Autonomie versprochen hatte.\n\nAls die Oktoberrevolution die Bolschewiki an die Macht brachte, versuchte Dowbor-Muśnicki, den Weg der Neutralität zu beschreiten, wurde aber auf die Seite der Weißen geworfen, nachdem die Polen allen Versuchen, sie zu entwaffnen, widerstanden hatten. Sein Korps übernahm die Kontrolle über die Stadt Bobruisk in Weißruthenien und hielt sich gegen die Bolschewiki, bis der Vertrag von Brest-Litowsk unterzeichnet wurde und die Bolschewiki sich aus den westlichen Gouvernements zurückzogen. Die deutsche Armee umzingelte Bobruisk, und es kam zu einer Pattsituation. Viele von Dowbor-Muśnickis Offizieren wollten bis zum Schluss gegen die Deutschen kämpfen und versuchten, einen erfolglosen Putsch gegen den angesehenen General zu verüben. Nach ihrem Scheitern kapitulierte Dowbor-Muśnicki und wurde zusammen mit seiner Armee als Kriegsgefangener in das neu gegründete Königreich Polen überstellt.\n\nNach dem Krieg trat Dowbor-Muśnicki in den Dienst der neuen polnischen Armee und wurde zu einem ihrer erfahrensten Generäle. Er hat viel dafür getan, dass die Armee unpolitisch ist - indem er die Radikalen von Beförderungen fernhielt, aber auch indem er bei alten Ereignissen ein Auge zudrückte. Nach Dowbor-Muśnickis Worten ist er ein Nationalist und nur ein Nationalist, da er der Meinung ist, dass die Militärs keine politischen Ansichten haben sollten. Diese Haltung hat ihn als sehr unterstützend für den Status quo der von Deutschland unterstützten Monarchie erscheinen lassen, und seine Feinde in den politischen Extremen stellen Dowbor-Muśnicki gerne als Feigling dar, der sein ganzes Leben lang nur fremden Herren gedient hat. Seine Anhänger - vor allem \"die Dowborianer\", die Männer aus seinem Korps - verehren ihn als klugen und pragmatischen Anführer, der unzählige Leben gerettet hat."

Auch wenn diese Entscheidung bei den außenstehenden Polen nicht auf Gegenliebe stoßen wird, so haben sie doch im Gegenzug für die in diesen Zeiten dringend benötigte Unterstützung durch den Palast gewisse Schmiergelder versprochen."
 POL_Empower_Elites: "Arbeit mit den Eliten"
 POL_Empower_Elites_desc: "Nun, da die Position der engsten Berater des Königs gefestigt ist, haben sie begonnen, seiner Majestät weitere \"Vorschläge\" zu machen, hier einen Mitarbeiter zu ernennen, dort eine bestimmte Person zu befördern. Als Gegenleistung für die Befolgung ihrer Ratschläge haben sie sich große Mühe gegeben, das Kapital zu lenken, das seinen Weg ins Königreich finden könnte, und im Gegenzug dem Spross eines Industriellen einen bequemen Posten in der Bürokratie verschafft."
 POL_Royal_Tours: "Königliche Reisen"
 POL_Royal_Tours_desc: "Ein bedauerlicher Nebeneffekt der Entscheidung des Königs, viele Deutsche in eine gefestigte Machtposition zu bringen, ist das wachsende Gefühl in der Bevölkerung, dass die Monarchie weitaus mehr deutsche als polnische Interessen vertritt. Um dieses Gefühl zu beschwichtigen, haben die Mitarbeiter des Königs eine umfangreiche Liste von Besichtigungsrouten und Details zu Schirmherrschaften erstellt, die dem Palast viel Wohlwollen beim Durchschnittsbürger einbringen werden."
 POL_Direction_of_the_Privy_Council: "Ausrichtung des Geheimen Rates"
 POL_Direction_of_the_Privy_Council_desc: "Nachdem der König damit begonnen hat, die Zusammensetzung seines inneren Kreises zu gestalten, richtet sich die Aufmerksamkeit nun auf den Geheimen Rat. Dieses Gremium, das sich aus einer Mischung aus deutschen und polnischen Mitgliedern zusammensetzt, steht dem König sehr nahe und spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei der Pflege der Beziehungen zwischen dem Palast und den verschiedenen Gruppen. Der König wird sich genau überlegen müssen, wen er in seinen Rat berufen will, denn es wird schwierig sein, die Forderungen der Deutschen und der Polen unter einen Hut zu bringen."
 POL_Foster_Polish_German_Ties: "Polnisch-Deutsche Beziehungen fördern"
 POL_Foster_Polish_German_Ties_desc: "Während die Bemühungen des Königs, die Unterstützung mächtiger deutscher Interessen zu gewinnen, erste Früchte tragen, fordern viele seiner Berater nun, dass er die Beziehungen noch weiter vertieft und die polnische Nation fest in den deutschen Schoß einbindet. Sie sind sich sicher, dass sie ihre Kontakte in Berlin davon überzeugen können, erhebliche Investitionen in die Wirtschaft des Landes zu tätigen, sofern der König deutlich macht, dass er ein fester Freund Berlins ist."
 POL_Guarantee_The_Holdings_Of_Landowners: "Garantien für den Besitz von Landeigentümern"
 POL_Guarantee_The_Holdings_Of_Landowners_desc: "Der König möchte jedoch klarstellen, dass diese Schritte keineswegs bedeuten, dass es Pläne gibt, große ländliche Interessen zu zerschlagen. Der Palast plant, dies durch die Schaffung rechtlicher Garantien gegen \"ungerechte Enteignungen\" zu erreichen, obwohl er hinter verschlossenen Türen den Aristokraten deutlich gemacht hat, dass er für solche Versprechen Hilfe erwartet."
 POL_Address_Land_Issue: "Angehen der Landfrage"
 POL_Address_Land_Issue_desc: "Zwar wünscht sich kaum jemand in der Regierung einen Landraub, von dem Centrolew spricht, doch gibt es in unserer derzeitigen Situation viel zu verbessern. Es gibt viele Ländereien, die sehr ineffizient bewirtschaftet werden, und auch viele, die zu klein sind, um wirklich produktiv zu sein. Durch die Rationalisierung der Landnutzung sollten wir in der Lage sein, die Produktivität der polnischen Landwirtschaft zu verbessern."
 POL_Weapon_Against_The_Underground: "Eine Waffe gegen den Untergrund"
 POL_Weapon_Against_The_Underground_desc: "Es bestand schon immer der Verdacht, dass Schattenorganisationen einen erheblichen Teil der Macht im Lande ausüben, aber das genaue Ausmaß war immer ein Geheimnis. Aus diesem Grund haben wir mit dem Ausbau unserer Inlandsnachrichtendienste begonnen, um den Intriganten im Untergrund endlich das Handwerk zu legen."
 POL_Rein_in_Sejm: "Den Sejm zügeln"
 POL_Rein_in_Sejm_desc: "Eine gewisse Form der Kommunikation zwischen dem Volk und dem König kann zwar gut sein, aber der Sejm hat viel zu viel Macht genossen, um zu tun, was er will. Im inneren Kreis des Königs gibt es viele, die gegen das Gremium wettern und die wahren Absichten vieler seiner Vertreter in Frage stellen. Auch wenn es verschiedene Möglichkeiten gibt, diese vermeintlich verräterischen Elemente aus dem Weg zu räumen, bedeutet dieser Schritt eine radikale Veränderung des Gleichgewichts zwischen Palast und Sejm."
 POL_Safeguard_the_Liberties: "Wahrung der Freiheitsrechte"
 POL_Safeguard_the_Liberties_desc: "Es gibt zwar viele abweichende politische Meinungen, die wir für gefährlich oder schädlich halten, aber sie anzugreifen oder zum Schweigen zu bringen, würde wahrscheinlich nur zu weit größeren Gegenreaktionen führen. Aus diesem Grund fordern gemäßigtere Mitglieder des inneren Kreises des Königs die Verankerung von Grundrechten auf Meinungsfreiheit und andere Freiheiten im Königreich, damit diese gefährlichen Stimmen zwar schreien können, aber nur wenige einen Grund haben, zuzuhören."

 POL_Drop_The_Gold_Standard: "Abschaffung des Goldstandards"
 POL_Drop_The_Gold_Standard_desc: "Der Goldstandard ist seit langem Teil des konventionellen wirtschaftlichen Denkens, wobei viele durch die Stabilität, die die Golddeckung zu bieten schien, getröstet wurden. Für viele pro-deutsche Interessen war unsere Wirtschaft dadurch fest an das goldgedeckte Mitteleuropa gebunden. Mit dem Absturz des Schwarzen Montags hat die Abhängigkeit vom Gold unsere Wirtschaft handlungsunfähig gemacht. Um dieser Falle zu entkommen, fordern nun viele in der Regierung, die Golddeckung aufzugeben und zu einer reinen Papiergeld-Währung überzugehen."
 POL_Reintroduce_The_Zloty: "Den Złoty treiben lassen"
 POL_Reintroduce_The_Zloty_desc: "Als wir unsere Währung aus dem Goldstandard lösten, mussten wir vorsichtig sein, um einen totalen Währungskollaps zu vermeiden. Nun, da einige Zeit vergangen ist, können wir den Złoty in seiner neuen frei treibenden Form wieder einführen. Dies wird zwar wahrscheinlich zu stärker schwankenden Preisen führen, sollte uns aber hoffentlich mehr Mittel an die Hand geben, um uns aus der Krise herauszuarbeiten, und uns gleichzeitig etwas Unterstützung für eine von Berlin unabhängigere Währung verschaffen."
 POL_Loans_From_Foreign_Banks: "Kredite von ausländischen Banken"
 POL_Loans_From_Foreign_Banks_desc: "Während der Zusammenbruch viele dazu veranlasst hat, den großen deutschen und österreichischen Finanzinstituten zu misstrauen, die sie für den Zusammenbruch verantwortlich machen, ist es eine Tatsache, dass diese Organisationen immer noch über beträchtliches Kapital verfügen, das genutzt werden kann, um uns aus dem Zusammenbruch herauszuholen. Mit diesem Schritt wird zwar der Status quo der Bindung an Berlin und Wien beibehalten, aber es wird viel leichter sein, unsere Wirtschaft aus der Krise zu führen."
 POL_Nationalise_The_Bank_Of_Poland: "Verstaatlichung der Bank von Polen"
 POL_Nationalise_The_Bank_Of_Poland_desc: "In den Augen vieler hat dieser Absturz gezeigt, wie gefährlich es ist, unsere Wirtschaft an Großmächte zu binden, die ihre Interessen immer über unsere stellen werden. Aus diesem Grund wollen viele, dass wir eine unabhängigere Steuerpolitik betreiben, die uns ihrer Meinung nach vor künftigen Instabilitäten schützen wird. Dieser Schritt wird jedoch nicht ohne Folgen bleiben, da es ohne die riesigen Reserven von Berlin und Wien sehr viel schwieriger sein wird, Kapital zu beschaffen."
 POL_Pave_The_Country_Roads: "Pflastern der Landstraßen"
 POL_Pave_The_Country_Roads_desc: "Der Zusammenbruch hat dazu geführt, dass viele Menschen keine Arbeit finden, was eine negative Rückkopplungsschleife ausgelöst hat, in der sie nicht in der Lage sind, Geld auszugeben, was wiederum dazu führt, dass diejenigen, die von ihren Kunden abhängig sind, ebenfalls untergehen. Um diesen Kreislauf zu durchbrechen, haben viele vorgeschlagen, unsere Arbeitslosen in großen öffentlichen Bauvorhaben arbeiten zu lassen, was den Nebeneffekt hat, dass auch unsere Infrastruktur in bisher vernachlässigten Gebieten verbessert wird."
 POL_The_Cooperative_Movement: "Die Genossenschafts-Bewegung"
 POL_The_Cooperative_Movement_desc: "Bäuerliche Genossenschaften sind seit langem eine Möglichkeit für die ärmere Landbevölkerung, ihr Los zu verbessern. Die Kombination aus Sicherheit und sozialer Teilhabe für die Landbevölkerung hat sie zu einer sehr nützlichen Institution gemacht, die es zu fördern gilt. Aus diesem Grund schlagen viele vor, die Gründung neuer Genossenschaften zu fördern, die einen großen Beitrag dazu leisten würden, unsere Lebensmittelerzeuger vor Marktschwankungen zu schützen."
 POL_Marketplace_of_Mitteleuropa: "Marktplatz von Mitteleuropa"
 POL_Marketplace_of_Mitteleuropa_desc: "Die Handelsmöglichkeiten, die sich in Polen dank unserer Lage zwischen Deutschland und Österreich bieten, sollten nicht so leicht außer Acht gelassen werden. Es gibt zwar viele, die vorschlagen, unser Land durch die Ankurbelung der Binnenwirtschaft aus der Krise zu führen, aber in Wirklichkeit ist die Förderung eines starken Exportmarktes ein weitaus bewährterer Weg, um Geld in unser Land zu bringen. Wir werden damit beginnen, die Exportmärkte gegenüber den inländischen Märkten zu fördern, um solche Bedingungen zu schaffen."
 POL_The_Statist_Approach: "Das statistische Konzept"
 POL_The_Statist_Approach_desc: "Viele würden lieber unsere Wirtschaft an ausländische Interessen verkaufen, um mehr Geld einzunehmen, und dabei die grundlegenden Probleme ignorieren, die entstehen, wenn wir unsere finanzielle Stabilität in die Hände anderer Nationen legen. Wenn wir uns tatsächlich von dem Absturz erholen wollen, müssen wir die Wirtschaft für unsere Bürger ankurbeln. Indem wir die inländischen Ausgaben und den Handel fördern, können wir die Grundlagen unserer Wirtschaft wiederherstellen, anstatt uns auf eine vage Hoffnung auf einen Aufschwung zu verlassen, der aus Berlin hereintröpfelt."

 POL_The_Second_Four_Year_Plan: "Der zweite Vier-Jahres-Plan"
 POL_The_Second_Four_Year_Plan_desc: "Auch wenn der erste Vierjahresplan keine perfekte Wirtschaftspolitik war, sind die positiven Auswirkungen des Plans unbestreitbar. Angesichts einer weiteren Periode des industriellen und wirtschaftlichen Niedergangs wollen viele in der Regierung einen zweiten Plan auflegen, in der Hoffnung, etwas von der Magie des ersten Plans wiederzuerlangen. Dieser wird unserer Nation hohe industrielle Ziele setzen, aber sollte er erfolgreich sein, wird er den Weg für eine neue, blühende Zeit für die polnische Industrie ebnen."
 POL_Attract_German_Corporations_Plan: "Deutscher Investitionsplan"
 POL_Attract_German_Corporations_Plan_desc: "Auch wenn wir es vermeiden wollen, unsere Wirtschaft unnötig von ausländischem Kapital abhängig zu machen, so ist es doch eine Tatsache, dass es uns schwer fallen wird, unsere industriellen Ziele allein zu erreichen. Deshalb werden wir damit beginnen, Kredite bei deutschen Banken aufzunehmen, mit dem allgemeinen Ziel, dass wir in der Lage sein werden, sie durch die von ihnen finanzierte industrielle Expansion leicht zurückzuzahlen."
 POL_Rural_Literacy_Campaigns: "Ländliche Alphabetisierungskampagnen"
 POL_Rural_Literacy_Campaigns_desc: "Ein großer Teil der Landbevölkerung hatte nie die Möglichkeit, irgendeine Form von Bildung zu erhalten, was die wirtschaftliche Kluft und die Aufstiegsprobleme in unserem Land erheblich verschärft hat. Um die Hindernisse zu beseitigen, mit denen viele Menschen auf dem Lande aufgrund ihrer mangelnden Bildung konfrontiert sind, werden wir unsere Bemühungen zur Beseitigung des Analphabetismus auf dem Lande in unserem Land verstärken. Das mag zwar kostspielig sein, aber wir hoffen, dass es sich auf lange Sicht auszahlen wird."
 POL_Renovate_The_University_Of_Warsaw: "Modernisierung der Universität Warschau"
 POL_Renovate_The_University_Of_Warsaw_desc: "Die Universität Warschau wurde 1816 gegründet und hat eine lange Tradition in der Ausbildung der klügsten Köpfe Polens. Diese Tradition verleiht ihr zwar viel Prestige, aber ein modernes Bildungszentrum erfordert weit mehr als nur Status - es gibt viele neue Bereiche, die spezialisierte Einrichtungen für ihre Erforschung erfordern, und wenn wir unsere führende Bildungseinrichtung auf dem neuesten Stand mit ausländischen Kollegen halten wollen, müssen wir in ihre Modernisierung investieren."
 POL_Fuel_the_Industries: "Brennstoff für die Industrie"
 POL_Fuel_the_Industries_desc: "Während wir uns bei unserem Reichtum traditionell auf das verlassen haben, was oberhalb der Erdoberfläche zu finden ist, blicken viele jetzt begierig auf den potenziellen Schatz, der darunter liegt. Nicht Diamanten oder Gold, sondern Kohle. Sehr viel davon. Während viele dieser Vorkommen für den heimischen Gebrauch ausgebeutet wurden, hat die Ausweitung des Bergbaus auf ein echtes industrielles Ausmaß das Potenzial, die Wirtschaft unseres Landes zu verändern - und nicht nur mit der Kohle selbst Geld zu verdienen, sondern auch mit den vielen Industrien, die Kohle für ihren Betrieb benötigen."
 POL_Expansion_Of_The_Electrical_Grid: "Ausbau des Stromnetzes"
 POL_Expansion_Of_The_Electrical_Grid_desc: "Die zahlreichen Vorteile der Elektrifizierung werden von niemandem bestritten. Diese Technologie gibt es in unseren Städten, seit 1880 in Warschau die erste elektrische Beleuchtung installiert wurde. Obwohl der Sektor seither ein stetiges Wachstum verzeichnet, gibt es immer noch viele Menschen in unserem Land, die nicht in den Genuss der Vorteile der Elektrizität kommen. Im Rahmen der Modernisierung der Wirtschaft fordern viele einen gezielten Ausbau der Stromversorgung in unserem Land, damit keine Stadt im Dunkeln bleibt."
 POL_Modernise_Urban_Infrastructure: "Städtische Infrastruktur modernisieren"
 POL_Modernise_Urban_Infrastructure_desc: "Viele unserer Städte sind alt, und ihre Infrastruktur spiegelt dies wider. Eine Kombination aus Alter und Unterfinanzierung hat dazu geführt, dass unsere Städte archaisch erscheinen und viele öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Wohnungen entweder an ihre Grenzen stoßen oder verfallen. Es wurde eine Reihe ehrgeiziger Pläne zur vollständigen Wiederbelebung der polnischen Städte und ihrer Dienstleistungen ausgearbeitet."
 POL_The_Central_Industrial_Region: "Die zentrale Industrieregion"
 POL_The_Central_Industrial_Region_desc: "Das Flaggschiff unseres ehrgeizigen Industrieprogramms, die Zentrale Industrieregion, wird eine Konzentration der polnischen Industrieproduktion in der Region um Warschau sein. Dies wird den Vorteil haben, im Zentrum unserer Nation und unserer Wirtschaft zu liegen - ein pulsierendes industrielles Herz, das die Umwandlung unserer Wirtschaft in die einer modernen Industriegesellschaft repräsentieren wird."
 POL_Fund_The_Construction_Sector: "Finanzierung des Bausektors"
 POL_Fund_The_Construction_Sector_desc: "Es mag überflüssig klingen, aber es ist unmöglich, eine Industrieregion ohne die entsprechenden Baudienstleistungen zu errichten, da wir bereits jetzt feststellen, dass die Unternehmen Schwierigkeiten haben, die Anforderungen moderner Fabriken zu erfüllen. Es werden Mittel für den Ausbau und die Modernisierung von Bauunternehmen und deren Ausrüstung bereitgestellt. Wir hoffen, dass wir dadurch das Wachstum unserer industriellen Kapazitäten beschleunigen können."
 POL_War_Industry_Bureau: "Büro für die Kriegsindustrie."
 POL_War_Industry_Bureau_desc: "Während die zunehmenden Spannungen auf dem Kontinent schlecht für den Frieden sind, sind sie eine gute Zeit für Waffenhersteller. Aus pragmatischer Sicht ist die Fähigkeit, über einen starken Waffensektor zu verfügen, von großem Nutzen, wenn die Nation ihn einmal brauchen sollte. Dies ist der Grund für die Einrichtung des Büros für Kriegsindustrie, das die Rüstungsproduktion und die logistische Beschaffung des Militärs beaufsichtigen wird."
 POL_Eastern_Europes_Workshop: "Osteuropas Werkstatt"
 POL_Eastern_Europes_Workshop_desc: "Wenn wir auf unsere Bemühungen zurückblicken, ein neues Kronjuwel unserer Wirtschaft zu errichten, ist es fast gerechtfertigt, ein kleines Gefühl von Stolz zu empfinden. Wir haben das Gebiet um Warschau in eines der bedeutendsten Industriezentren in ganz Mitteleuropa verwandelt, das sich durch seine Größe und Modernität auszeichnet. Es bleibt noch viel zu tun, aber ein neues goldenes Zeitalter für die polnische Industrie hat gerade erst begonnen."
 POL_Consumer_Industry: "Ausweitung der Konsumgüterindustrie"
 POL_Consumer_Industry_desc: "Auch wenn die Schwerindustrie für sich genommen beeindruckend klingt, sollte man nicht vergessen, dass sie sinnlos ist, wenn es niemanden gibt, der ihre Produkte kauft. Deshalb dürfen wir nicht vergessen, uns auch auf den Ausbau des Sektors der leichten Konsumgüter zu konzentrieren. Die Steigerung der Kaufkraft unserer Bevölkerung wird das Wirtschaftswachstum ankurbeln und hoffentlich auch den durchschnittlichen Lebensstandard verbessern."
 POL_Stalowa_Wola: "Stalowa Wola (Stählerner Wille)"
 POL_Stalowa_Wola_desc: "Um das Wachstum unseres neuen industriellen Kernlandes zu fördern, wurde viel über die Errichtung von Stahlwerken in der Region gesprochen, um die dort bereits vorhandenen Kohle- und Eisenerzvorkommen zu nutzen. Dieses Stahlwerk, bekannt als Huta Stalowa Wola, wird Tausende von Arbeitsplätzen in der Region schaffen, und es gibt sogar Pläne für eine komplett geplante Stadt, in der die Arbeiter des Werks untergebracht werden sollen."
 POL_Expand_The_Chemical_Industry: "Ausbau der chemischen Industrie"
 POL_Expand_The_Chemical_Industry_desc: "Die neuen und aufregenden Industriezweige des synthetischen Kautschuks und der Kraftstoffherstellung haben das Potenzial, ein großer Segen für Nationen wie die unsere zu sein, die mit der ausreichenden Versorgung mit Ressourcen zu kämpfen haben. Mit Hilfe deutscher Petrochemie-Experten wird staatliches Kapital in die Gründung neuer Anlagen für synthetischen Kautschuk in der Nähe der Stadt Dębica fließen, die hoffentlich der erste Schritt in einen neuen Wirtschaftssektor sein werden, der uns zu mehr Selbstständigkeit verhilft."
 POL_Domestic_Aircraft_Manufacturing: "Inländischer Flugzeugbau"
 POL_Domestic_Aircraft_Manufacturing_desc: "Die neuen Bereiche der Luftfahrt werden von vielen als die Zukunft des Reisens und der Kriegsführung angesehen. Aus diesem Grund wird das nächste Ziel staatlicher Investitionen allgemein in der Schaffung und dem Ausbau eines vollwertigen Luftfahrtsektors gesehen, von dem man hofft, dass er in der Lage ist, einheimische Flugzeuge zu produzieren, die mit den einheimischen Bemühungen in anderen Ländern vergleichbar sind. Obwohl sie auf staatliche Investitionen angewiesen sind, hoffen viele, dass diese Unternehmen schon bald in der Lage sein werden, aus eigener Kraft aufzusteigen."

 POL_The_General_Inspectorate: "Generalinspektion"
 POL_The_General_Inspectorate_desc: "Leider hat man es den polnischen Streitkräften viel zu lange gestattet, in einem Zustand der Stagnation zu verharren, doch angesichts der zunehmenden Spannungen auf dem gesamten Kontinent ist endlich der Wille vorhanden, unsere Streitkräfte von Grund auf zu erneuern. Der erste Schritt dazu ist die Schaffung eines separaten Gremiums, das die Modernisierung der Streitkräfte überwacht und hoffentlich eine Form der Unparteilichkeit ermöglicht, um zu verhindern, dass neue Mittel lediglich die Gehälter der Offiziere erhöhen."
 POL_Structural_Reorganisations: "Strukturelle Umstrukturierungen"
 POL_Structural_Reorganisations_desc: "Um mit der Reform unserer Streitkräfte zu beginnen, müssen wir zunächst die grundlegenden Strukturen, aus denen sie bestehen, in Angriff nehmen. Indem wir die Verwaltungs- und Kommandostrukturen unserer Streitkräfte vereinheitlichen und aktualisieren, können wir den Grundstein für künftiges Wachstum und Expansion legen, in der Gewissheit, dass Ineffizienzen und Unregelmäßigkeiten beseitigt worden sind."
 POL_Malkowski_And_Malkowskas_Legacy: "Malkowskis und Malkowskas Vermächtnis"
 POL_Malkowski_And_Malkowskas_Legacy_desc: "Die Grundsätze und die Disziplin der Pfadfinderei in Verbindung mit der Vermittlung nützlicher Fähigkeiten wie Navigieren und Wandern sind äußerst nützlich, um jungen Kindern militärische Grundsätze zu vermitteln und ihnen gleichzeitig spannende außerschulische Aktivitäten zu bieten. Das Pfadfindertum in Polen wurde von Olga Małkowska und Andrzej Małkowski gefördert, die Institute zur Vermittlung von Pfadfinderprinzipien gründeten. Durch die Förderung dieser Organisationen werden wir eine Generation heranziehen, die in vielen nützlichen Fähigkeiten ausgebildet ist."
 POL_Saving_Polish_Blood: "Polnisches Blut retten"
 POL_Saving_Polish_Blood_desc: "Auch wenn die Bereitschaft unserer Soldaten, alles für ihr Land zu geben, niemals entmutigt werden sollte, so sollten wir doch versuchen, unnötiges Leid so weit wie möglich zu vermeiden. Für jeden schnellen Heldentod wird es unzählige langsame Tode geben - gebrochene Körper, die ihren Lebenssaft in den Boden bluten. Durch rechtzeitiges und geschultes medizinisches Eingreifen können wir so viel wie möglich davon verhindern und sie wieder in den Kampf schicken - oder zumindest dafür sorgen, dass ihre Angehörigen noch eine Stimme hören."
 POL_Lessons_of_the_Trenches: "Lektionen aus den Schützengräben"
 POL_Lessons_of_the_Trenches_desc: "Das Erbe der Schützengräben verfolgt die Gesellschaft als das bleibende Bild des Weltkriegs: Schlamm und Kälte, verschlimmert durch schlechte Baupraktiken und die Weigerung zu akzeptieren, dass dauerhaftere Befestigungen notwendig sein würden. In der Zukunft wird es wahrscheinlich notwendig sein, zu akzeptieren, dass Schützengräben eine Schlüsselrolle spielen werden, und indem wir diese Tatsache akzeptieren, können wir uns hoffentlich darauf vorbereiten, unsere Schützengräben erträglicher und verteidigungsfähiger für diejenigen zu machen, die gezwungen sind, sie zu benutzen."
 POL_Obrona_Narodowa: "Obrona Narodowa (Landesverteidigung)"
 POL_Obrona_Narodowa_desc: "Die Idee, die Operationen der offiziellen Truppen durch sekundäre Einheiten zu unterstützen, gibt es schon seit langem, und überall auf der Welt existieren verschiedene Milizen mit diesem Ziel. Um diese Praxis jedoch effizienter zu gestalten, schlagen viele in unserem Militär eine staatlich geförderte Freiwilligentruppe vor, die das stehende Heer unterstützen soll. Der Name, den sie für diese Organisation vorschlagen, ist Obrona Narodowa - Landesverteidigung."
 POL_Mossors_Cavalry_Reform: "Mossors Kavallerie-Reform"
 POL_Mossors_Cavalry_Reform_desc: "Im Westen wurde die Rolle der Kavallerieeinheiten durch das Maschinengewehrfeuer in Stücke gerissen: Das Bild der Kavallerie, die mit Säbeln in den Tod stürmt, wurde zu einem bestimmenden Begriff des Krieges. Im Osten hingegen hat die Kavallerie aufgrund der weiten Ebenen und des flüssigeren Charakters der Kriegsführung immer noch ihren Platz, aber sie kann nicht unverändert überleben. Aus diesem Grund hat einer unserer Kommandeure, Stefan Mosser, einen Reformplan ausgearbeitet, in dem er vorschlägt, unsere Kavallerie in eine Form von mobiler Elite-Infanterie umzuwandeln."
 POL_Equestrian_AT: "Pferdetaugliche AT-Ausrüstung"
 POL_Equestrian_AT_desc: "Viele sehen in gepanzerten Fahrzeugen das Ende der berittenen Kriegsführung, doch die Realität ist nicht annähernd so einfach. Aufgrund ihrer Vielseitigkeit sind Pferde viel besser in der Lage, das Gelände zu durchqueren als Fahrzeuge. Befürworter der Kavallerie schlagen vor, diesen Vorteil auszubauen, indem die Kavallerie mit kleinen Panzerabwehrwaffen wie AT-Gewehren ausgestattet wird, die es ihr ermöglichen, Panzerungen zu durchdringen und diese Fahrzeuge zu zerstören."
 POL_Motorised_Dragoons: "Motorisierte Dragoner"
 POL_Motorised_Dragoons_desc: "Indem die Ausrüstung einer Kavalleriedivision mit Lastwagen und nicht mit Pferden transportiert wird, erhöht sich die durchschnittliche Geschwindigkeit einer Einheit, und sie ist in der Lage, mehr und schwerere Unterstützungswaffen einzusetzen, wodurch sie mit der Kampfkraft einer normalen Infanteriedivision gleichzieht."
 POL_Centre_for_Higher_Military_Studies: "Zentrum für höhere militärische Studien"
 POL_Centre_for_Higher_Military_Studies_desc: "Während Initiative und natürliches Geschick traditionell alles waren, was gute Offiziere brauchten, wird die zunehmend komplexe Natur der modernen Kriegsführung Männer erfordern, die in der Lage sind, Dinge zu verstehen, die man nicht einfach im Job lernen kann. Zu diesem Zweck werden wir einen neuen militärischen Denkfabrik einrichten, der das Verständnis unserer Offiziere für moderne militärische Taktiken und Strategien verbessern und fördern soll."
 POL_Expand_The_Academy_Of_Warsaw: "Erweiterung der Akademie von Warschau"
 POL_Expand_The_Academy_Of_Warsaw_desc: "Die Akademie in Warschau ist das Zentrum unseres Offizierskorps und bildet viele der Nachwuchsoffiziere und Strategen aus, die unser Militär prägen. Wenn wir die Mittel für diese Einrichtung aufstocken, können wir sicherstellen, dass sie weiterhin erstklassige Absolventen hervorbringt. Es ist jedoch auch wahrscheinlich, dass diese Modernisierung zu einem verstärkten doktrinären Streit zwischen den verschiedenen Denkschulen führen wird. Es bleibt abzuwarten, welche sich als Orthodoxie durchsetzen wird."
 POL_Combined_Arms_Warfare: "Kombinierte Waffenkriegsführung"
 POL_Combined_Arms_Warfare_desc: "In den letzten Jahren des Weltkriegs entwickelte sich eine ganz andere Art von Krieg als zu Beginn. Während die Männer über die Felder Frankreichs marschierten, waren sie nicht mehr der einzige entscheidende Faktor: Über ihnen bombardierten und kämpften Flugzeuge, die Artillerie hinter den Linien duellierte sich mit größerer Präzision, Reichweite und Feuerkraft als alles andere im Jahr 1914, während brutale Metalltiere neben ihnen rumpelten. So wird der nächste Krieg geführt werden. Wir müssen darauf vorbereitet sein."
 POL_Start_The_Six_Year_Plan: "Start des Sechsjahresplans"
 POL_Start_The_Six_Year_Plan_desc: "Die Modernisierung, die Reform und der Ausbau unseres Militärs sind zwar ein lobenswerter Gedanke, aber diese Pläne sind kaum mehr als Phantasien, wenn wir nicht über die Industrie verfügen, die eine solche Streitkraft aufbauen kann. Aus diesem Grund werden wir unser Programm zum Ausbau der Streitkräfte mit einem parallelen Programm zum Ausbau der Rüstungsindustrie verbinden, das, wie andere Regierungsmitglieder vorschlagen, in umfassendere industrielle Pläne eingebunden werden könnte."
 POL_Military_Research_And_Education_Institute: "Militärisches Forschungs- und Bildungsinstitut"
 POL_Military_Research_And_Education_Institute_desc: "Die fortschrittliche Ausrüstung, die für die moderne Kriegsführung benötigt wird, erfordert echte Innovationen und Finanzmittel, um sie in die Realität umzusetzen: Aus diesem Grund wird die Regierung die Einrichtung einer Stelle anordnen, die die militärische Forschung organisiert und sicherstellt, dass die Mittel in die richtigen Projekte fließen. Diese Stelle wird auch für die Zuweisung von Finanzmitteln für Projekte zuständig sein, die andernfalls Schwierigkeiten haben würden."
 POL_Maroszeks_Self_Loading_Rifle: "Maroszek's Selbstladegewehr"
 POL_Maroszeks_Self_Loading_Rifle_desc: "Ein Ingenieur namens Józef Maroszek ist mit einer interessanten Demonstration in das neue Militärinstitut gekommen: ein persönlicher Entwurf, den er seit einigen Jahren für ein Gewehr verfeinert hat, das viel einfacher zu bedienen ist als die derzeitigen Repetiergewehre, da es in der Lage ist, jedes Mal zu schießen, wenn der Abzug betätigt wird (vorausgesetzt natürlich, es ist Munition vorhanden). Dieser Entwurf fand schnell die Unterstützung des Instituts und wurde als eines der ersten Projekte für eine weitere Finanzierung genehmigt."
 POL_Artillery_Modernisation: "Artillerie-Modernisierung"
 POL_Artillery_Modernisation_desc: "Die Artillerie hat sich als einer der größten Entscheider des modernen Krieges erwiesen, und die Innovationen während des Ersten Weltkriegs haben das Gebiet der Artillerieforschung grundlegend verändert. Zwanzig Jahre später jedoch erscheinen unsere Artillerieausrüstung und -ausbildung allmählich veraltet, und es besteht ein neues Interesse daran, unser Artilleriekorps zu modernisieren, es mit besseren Geschützen auszustatten und es in modernen Berechnungen und Entfernungsmessungen zu schulen."
 POL_Finish_The_8TP_Programme: "Abschluss des 8TP-Programms"
 POL_Finish_The_8TP_Programme_desc: "Das Interesse an der Schaffung einer polnischen Panzertruppe, die sich aufgrund der relativ flachen geografischen Lage und der Tradition der mobilen Kriegsführung perfekt eignet, ist groß. Diese Bemühungen gipfelten in dem Programm 8TP, das auf dem schwedischen Landsverk L-60 basiert und mit dem die ersten gepanzerten Einheiten geschaffen werden sollen, um zu erforschen, wie sie im Feld am effizientesten arbeiten."
 POL_Project_Uruguay: "Project Urugwaj"
 POL_Project_Uruguay_desc: "Wir haben zwar mit der Erforschung der Panzertechnologie begonnen, aber im Vergleich zu den gepanzerten Fahrzeugen anderer Streitkräfte sind wir nur ein kleiner Fisch. Diese Tatsache hat uns veranlasst, mit der Erforschung spezieller Panzerabwehrwaffen und -taktiken zu beginnen, die es unserer Infanterie und anderen Einheiten ermöglichen werden, die metallenen Biester mit Leichtigkeit zu besiegen."
 POL_Improved_Tank_Designs: "Verbesserte Panzerkonstruktionen"
 POL_Improved_Tank_Designs_desc: "Unsere ersten Versuche mit Panzern haben viele davon überzeugt, die Vorteile einer modernen Kriegsführung zu erkennen, aber gleichzeitig haben uns die Lehren aus den Versuchseinheiten auch die Grenzen unserer derzeitigen Panzerfahrzeuge aufgezeigt. Um diese Hürde zu überwinden, werden neue Mittel für die Entwicklung besserer gepanzerter Fahrzeuge bereitgestellt, die es mit ausländischen Konkurrenten aufnehmen können."

 POL_Germanys_Eastern_Bulwark: "Deutschlands Bollwerk im Osten"
 POL_Germanys_Eastern_Bulwark_desc: "Unser Land grenzt an die Grenzstaaten im Osten und liegt in unmittelbarer Nähe zu Berlin und damit mitten in der deutschen Ordnung in Osteuropa. Diese Tatsache führt dazu, dass wir bei der strategischen Planung für das gesamte Bündnis eine entscheidende Rolle spielen. Indem wir unsere Nation als starke und stabile deutsche Bastion aufbauen, können wir uns im Bedarfsfall nützlich machen und erhalten gleichzeitig weitere Unterstützung aus Berlin für unser Militär."
 POL_Contracts_With_CWS: "Verträge mit CWS"
 POL_Contracts_With_CWS_desc: "Centralne Warsztaty Samochodowe (Zentrale Kfz-Werkstätten) wurde 1918 gegründet, um die Ausrüstung unserer Armee zu warten, und hat sich seit seinen bescheidenen Anfängen vergrößert, so dass es heute in der Lage ist, seine eigenen Autos und Motorräder zu produzieren. Es ist daher nur logisch, dass wir dieses einheimische Unternehmen unterstützen, indem wir ihm lukrative Aufträge für die Herstellung von Fahrzeugen für unsere Armee erteilen und so die wichtigen Verbindungen zwischen Militär und Industrie stärken."
 POL_Expand_PZInz: "PZInz erweitern"
 POL_Expand_PZInz_desc: "Państwowe Zakłady Inżynierii (Nationale Maschinenbaubetriebe) ist ein Unternehmen, das über relativ viel Erfahrung in der Herstellung einer breiten Palette von militärischen und zivilen Fahrzeugen verfügt, bei denen es sich häufig um Lizenzen ausländischer Konstruktionen handelt. Durch die Bereitstellung von Finanzmitteln für die Ausweitung der Produktion von gepanzerten Fahrzeugen im Inland erhalten wir Zugang zu einem relativ stabilen inländischen Lieferanten für unsere neuen gepanzerten Einheiten."
 POL_Develop_The_9TP: "Entwicklung des 9TP"
 POL_Develop_The_9TP_desc: "Das frühere 8TP-Programm hat gezeigt, welche Wirkung eine modernere Panzerflotte auf dem Schlachtfeld haben kann. Um an diesen Erfolg anzuknüpfen, wurden Pläne für die Entwicklung eines noch größeren, besser bewaffneten und effizienteren Fahrzeugs entwickelt. Dieser Panzer wurde von vielen seiner Konstrukteure als 9TP bezeichnet, und sollten wir ihn unterstützen, wird er unsere Panzertruppe wirklich zum Neid des Reichspakts machen."
 POL_Integrated_Communication: "Integrierte Kommunikation"
 POL_Integrated_Communication_desc: "Unsere Position in der Mitte des Reichspakts macht uns zu einem wichtigen Kommunikationszentrum. In diesem Zusammenhang ist es wichtig, dass unsere Armee als Einheit arbeiten und schnell und effizient miteinander kommunizieren kann. Um dies zu erleichtern, werden wir unser Kommunikationssystem zentral strukturieren und standardisieren, um sicherzustellen, dass die Informationen zu den richtigen Zeitpunkten an die richtigen Stellen gelangen können."
 POL_Artillery_from_the_Sky: "Artillerie aus dem Himmel"
 POL_Artillery_from_the_Sky_desc: "Im letzten Krieg war die Artillerie der Albtraum des einfachen Soldaten. Die Vorstellung, dass man selbst und alle Mitglieder der eigenen Einheit jederzeit von einem Feind ausgelöscht werden könnten, den man nicht sehen kann, ist ein starker Angstfaktor. Die moderne Technologie der Luftangriffe hat diese Vorstellung auf eine neue Ebene gehoben, wobei die Befürworter einer solchen Kriegsführung darauf hinweisen, dass Luftangriffe bei entsprechender Ausbildung weitaus chirurgischer sein können als Artillerieangriffe. Dieses Argument hat viele in unserem Militär überzeugt, wie es bei \"Kriegsgewinnlern\" oft der Fall ist."
 POL_Army-Air_Coordination: "Heer-Luft-Koordination"
 POL_Army-Air_Coordination_desc: "Zwar wird es immer gewisse Ressentiments zwischen den verschiedenen Teilstreitkräften geben, da die meisten Soldaten gerne glauben, dass sie es viel schlechter haben als ihre Kollegen, doch ist es wichtig, dass diese Gefühle nicht zu einer ausgewachsenen Rivalität zwischen den Teilstreitkräften führen. Auch wenn viele in der Armee die Bodeneinheiten als die einzigen betrachten, die wirklich wichtig sind, müssen wir sicherstellen, dass unsere Lufteinheiten eng mit ihnen zusammenarbeiten, um ihre Effizienz zu maximieren."
 POL_Mechanisation_of_Cavalry: "Mechanisierung der Kavallerie"
 POL_Mechanisation_of_Cavalry_desc: "Die Kavallerie hat zwar eine unglaubliche Leistung vollbracht, um ihre Taktik angesichts der raschen Entwicklung der Kriegsführung durch die Umwandlung in eine Art mobile Infanterie aufrechtzuerhalten, doch die traurige Tatsache ist, dass sie die Flut nur aufhält. Wir müssen unsere Kavallerietruppen mechanisieren, um sicherzustellen, dass ihre Schnelligkeit auch in den Kriegen von morgen noch von Bedeutung sein wird."
 POL_Centralized_Fuel_Supply: "Zentralisierte Kraftstoffversorgung"
 POL_Centralized_Fuel_Supply_desc: "Angesichts der zunehmenden Technisierung unserer Streitkräfte ist es wichtig, dass sie immer über genügend Treibstoff verfügen, um ihren Betrieb aufrechtzuerhalten. Dies hat zu der Forderung geführt, eine zentrale Organisation zu schaffen, die die Verteilung der Treibstoffvorräte unserer Nation verwaltet. Dies wird sich vor allem auf das Militär auswirken, da es den Zugang zu Öl sicherstellt, aber auch andere Kraftstoffreserven verwalten, um sicherzustellen, dass sie dorthin geleitet werden, wo sie benötigt werden."
 POL_Wojna_Blyskawiczna: "Wojna Błyskawiczna (Blitzkrieg)"
 POL_Wojna_Blyskawiczna_desc: "Die Umgestaltung unseres Militärs in eine mechanisierte Streitmacht hat dazu geführt, dass sich eine neue Kriegsdoktrin durchgesetzt hat, die auf Geschwindigkeit setzt, um Kriege zu gewinnen. Im Mittelpunkt steht dabei der Einsatz einer Vorhut aus Panzern und Luftstreitkräften, um die gegnerischen Kräfte zu durchbrechen, bevor die schnell vorrückende motorisierte Infanterie die Durchbrüche ausnutzt, bevor sich der Feind erholen kann. Diese Taktik hat unter unseren Truppen sogar den Namen \"Wojna Błyskawiczna\" - \"Blitzkrieg\" - erhalten."

 POL_Vanguard_of_the_Internationale: "Vorhut der Internationale"
 POL_Vanguard_of_the_Internationale_desc: "Die arbeitende Nation ist so einheitlich wie eine kämpfende Armee. Die Arbeit ist ein einigendes Prinzip für die Nation, so wie der Krieg für die Armee. Der polnische Arbeitersoldat wird der Speer in die Seite Ostdeutschlands sein, während die Kommunarden den deutschen Adler in den Westen stechen."
 POL_Operational_Planning: "Kunst der operativen Planung"
 POL_Operational_Planning_desc: "Genosse Rokossowski ist in sein Land zurückgekehrt und hat seine Theorien zur Tiefenoperation mitgebracht. Diese Theorie sieht den Einsatz mehrerer Armeeeinheiten vor, die alle als eine Einheit agieren. Das Prinzip hinter diesen massiven Operationen ist, dass man durch die Bewegung einer ganzen Front als Einheit die gegnerischen Einheiten auf taktischer Ebene vernichtet. Es wird einige Zeit dauern, bis dieser hochrangige Ansatz der Kriegsführung vollständig umgesetzt ist, aber die Ergebnisse, die er verspricht, werden es wert sein."
 POL_Local_Initiative: "Stärkung von lokaler Initiativee"
 POL_Local_Initiative_desc: "Auch wenn die strategische Ebene der Dreh- und Angelpunkt von Operationen in der Tiefe ist, bedeutet dies nicht, dass die individuelle taktische Ebene nicht auch wichtig ist. In diesem Zusammenhang müssen wir darauf achten, dass wir das eigenständige Denken in unseren Einheiten fördern, um sicherzustellen, dass die taktischen Vorteile, die sich bieten, von den Befehlshabern richtig genutzt werden."
 POL_Art_of_the_Misdirection: "Fertigkeit der Irreführung"
 POL_Art_of_the_Misdirection_desc: "Bei der gemeinsamen Verlegung unserer Streitkräfte ist es wichtig, dass wir unseren Feind nicht merken lassen, wie er manipuliert wird. Stattdessen sollten wir ihm das falsche Gefühl der Sicherheit vermitteln, dass die Operationen normal verlaufen. Diese Irreführung ist der Schlüssel zum Sieg über einen Feind, indem wir seine Angriffe durch vorgetäuschte Rückzüge abschwächen, bevor wir ihn mit einem strategischen Gegenschlag überwältigen. Wir müssen unsere kryptologischen Fähigkeiten verstärken, um sicherzustellen, dass der Feind unsere Pläne nicht entschlüsseln kann."
 POL_Spirit_of_Hussars: "Husarengeist"
 POL_Spirit_of_Hussars_desc: "Der Schlüssel zum Ausmanövrieren eines Gegners ist die Fähigkeit, dort zu sein, wo man sein will, bevor der Feind dies verhindern kann. Während dies traditionell dadurch erreicht wurde, dass Männer zum Marschieren gezwungen wurden, ermöglicht uns die moderne Technologie, uns schneller als jeder Infanterist zu bewegen. Indem wir unsere Armeeeinheiten mit Mitteln ausstatten, die es ihnen ermöglichen, ihre Ziele schnell zu erreichen, stellen wir sicher, dass sie ihre Feinde leicht ausmanövrieren können."
 POL_Coordination_with_Communards: "Koordinierung mit den Kommunarden"
 POL_Coordination_with_Communards_desc: "Indem wir uns der globalen Revolution anschließen, sind wir nur ein Teil des großen Kampfes zur Befreiung der gesamten Menschheit von den Fesseln der wirtschaftlichen Sklaverei geworden. Alleine wäre unsere Sache dem Untergang geweiht, aber durch die Zusammenarbeit mit unseren Mitsyndikalisten können wir wie die beiden Griffe eines Schraubstocks wirken und die Deutschen langsam in der Mitte zerquetschen. Um sicherzustellen, dass dies gut funktioniert, waren die Diplomaten der Internationalen Gemeinschaft sehr daran interessiert, Berater zu entsenden, um die Richtung unserer militärischen und militärischen Planung zu überwachen."
 POL_Tools_for_Shock_Troops: "Werkzeuge für die Stoßtruppen"
 POL_Tools_for_Shock_Troops_desc: "Damit unsere Einheiten den Feind durchbrechen und vernichten können, müssen sie entsprechend ausgerüstet sein, um ihre Gegner zu vernichten. Aus diesem Grund wurde die Entwicklung neuer Artillerie- und Infanterieausrüstung stark vorangetrieben, was hoffentlich dazu führen wird, dass unsere Divisionen auf einem weitaus höheren Niveau als ihre Gegner operieren können."
 POL_Eyes_in_the_Sky: "Augen aus dem Himmel"
 POL_Eyes_in_the_Sky_desc: "Auch wenn der Kampf am Boden der Schlüssel zu tief greifenden Operationen zu sein scheint, so ist es in Wirklichkeit etwas, das sich nicht in Zahlen ausdrücken lässt: Informationen. Die Fähigkeit zu wissen, wie sich der Feind bewegt, bevor er angreift, ist von unschätzbarem Wert für die Planung von Frontbewegungen. Aus diesem Grund besteht ein großes Interesse an der Entwicklung von Technologien zur Aufklärung der Bewegungen des Feindes, sowohl am Boden als auch in der Luft."
 POL_Concentrated_Destruction: "Geballte Zerstörung"
 POL_Concentrated_Destruction_desc: "Die Fähigkeit der Luftwaffe, einen Feind in Stücke zu reißen, ist von unschätzbarem Wert, da die Reichweite und Genauigkeit, die sie bieten kann, die Artillerie weit hinter sich lässt. Insbesondere die Entwicklungen bei den vielseitigen Mehrzweckbombern, die sowohl feindliche Einheiten als auch strategische Ziele angreifen können, sind für die Militärplaner von großem Interesse, da sie ihre Einsatzpläne bereichern."
 POL_Tactical_Annihilation: "Taktische Vernichtung"
 POL_Tactical_Annihilation_desc: "Während sich die Tiefe operative Doktrin in der Regel auf die strategische Ebene konzentriert, ist es wichtig, sich daran zu erinnern, was das Ziel dieser großen Schwärme von Armeeeinheiten ist: die vollständige und totale Vernichtung des Feindes auf taktischer Ebene. Indem wir einen stärkeren Feind zunächst schwächen und ihn dann, wenn er überfordert ist, vernichten, haben wir eine Art von Krieg geschaffen, bei der sich die Deutschen wünschen werden, nie gegen die polnischen Arbeiter marschiert zu sein."

 POL_Legacy_of_the_Legions: "Das Erbe der Legionen"
 POL_Legacy_of_the_Legions_desc: "Die polnischen Legionen, die während des Weltkriegs aufgestellt wurden, haben eine wichtige Rolle bei der Entwicklung des modernen polnischen Staates gespielt. Sie hatten keine Panzer oder Flugzeuge, sondern nur sture Herzen und einen unermüdlichen Glauben an die polnische Nation. Technologie ist nutzlos, wenn der Armee der Geist fehlt, sie zu nutzen, und auf diesen Aspekt sollten wir uns konzentrieren."
 POL_National_Defense_Fund: "Nationaler Verteidigungsfonds"
 POL_National_Defense_Fund_desc: "Militärische Anschaffungen sind ein teurer Prozess, vor allem wenn es darum geht, modernere Ausrüstung zu kaufen. Die Realität ist, dass die Finanzierung unserer militärischen Modernisierung uns in den Bankrott treiben kann. Um dieses Problem zu umgehen, wurde mit Unterstützung der Regierung und der Armee ein Vorschlag zur Einrichtung eines \"Nationalen Verteidigungsfonds\" ausgearbeitet, der Mittel aus einer Vielzahl von Quellen sammeln würde, einschließlich öffentlicher Spendenaktionen, die es uns ermöglichen sollten, das Kapital zur Finanzierung unseres Militärs zusammenzukratzen."
 POL_State_Aviation_Works: "State Aviation Works"
 POL_State_Aviation_Works_desc: "The development and production of aviation, vital to our national defence, cannot be left to the fickle hands of private contractors. Because of this, a plan has been established to take aircraft production completely under state management, to ensure that the designs created are completely up to government specifications and army demands."
 POL_Domestic_Plane_Models: "Einheimische Flugzeugtypen"
 POL_Domestic_Plane_Models_desc: "Während viele vorschlagen, einfach Lizenzen ausländischer Entwürfe zu produzieren, sind viele in nationalistischen Kreisen unzufrieden, weil dies unseren Luftfahrtentwicklungssektor in den Niedergang führen könnte. Aus diesem Grund gibt es eine breite Unterstützung dafür, bei der Herstellung unserer Flugzeuge stattdessen auf einheimische Flugzeugkonstrukteure zurückzugreifen, da dies zwar länger dauern kann, aber sicherstellt, dass wir bei der Entwicklung unserer Ausrüstung nicht an ausländische Unternehmen gebunden sind."
 POL_Modernisation_of_Artillery: "Modernisierung der Artillerie"
 POL_Modernisation_of_Artillery_desc: "Unsere frühere Modernisierung der Artillerieeinheiten hat zwar viel dazu beigetragen, dass diese Einheiten mit der sich rasch entwickelnden Kriegsführung Schritt halten können, aber es gibt immer ein Potenzial für weitere Innovationen. Neue Berechnungstechnologien und noch größere Geschütze bedeuten, dass ausreichende Investitionen es unseren Artillerieeinheiten ermöglichen könnten, den Feind noch härter zu treffen als bisher."
 POL_Motorisation_of_Cavalry: "Motorisierung der Kavallerie"
 POL_Motorisation_of_Cavalry_desc: "Wir verfügen zwar über einige der schlagkräftigsten Kavallerieeinheiten der Welt, aber leider ist das Ende der Pferde eingeläutet. Das Potenzial, das der Einsatz von Lastwagen und Autos für den Transport unserer Truppen bietet, ist einfach unvergleichlich. Indem wir unsere Kavallerieeinheiten von ihren traditionellen Reittieren auf diese Fahrzeuge umstellen, leiten wir für sie eine neue Ära ihrer stolzen Geschichte ein."
 POL_Adoption_of_14TP: "Einführung des 14TP"
 POL_Adoption_of_14TP_desc: "Während die Geschwindigkeit der leichten Panzer von den Befürwortern der Panzerung in unserem Land oft die meiste Aufmerksamkeit erhalten hat, blicken viele in Rydz-Śmigłys Kreisen nun eifrig auf den noch jungen Bereich der so genannten \"mittleren Panzer\" - Schwerer als ihre leichten Gegenstücke, aber immer noch relativ vielseitig, können diese nach Ansicht vieler eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Unterstützung von Infanterieangriffen und auch bei eigenen Operationen gegen Gegner spielen, die zu leicht bewaffnet sind, um ihnen etwas entgegenzusetzen."
 POL_Moral_Education: "Moralische Erziehung"
 POL_Moral_Education_desc: "Viele sehen in den Soldaten lediglich eine Uniform und eine Waffe, doch das ist weit von der Wahrheit entfernt. Unsere Soldaten repräsentieren den Stolz unserer Nation und die Bereitschaft, unsere Ideale zu schützen. Sie können dies nicht tun, wenn sie sich der Ideale, die sie im Dienst vertreten, nicht voll bewusst sind. Damit sie ihre Pflicht nie vergessen, hat die Armeeführung eine gesunde nationalistische Erziehung vorgeschlagen, die allen unseren Soldaten während ihrer Ausbildung zuteil werden soll und die Militär und Patriotismus miteinander verbindet."
 POL_National_Volunteer_Corps: "Nationale Freiwilligenkorps"
 POL_National_Volunteer_Corps_desc: "Die langsame Zermürbung im Kampf ist ein bedauerlicher, aber unvermeidlicher Teil des modernen Krieges. Wenn erfahrene Truppen durch Kämpfe dezimiert werden, neigen die Männer, die sie ersetzen, dazu, weniger erfahren zu sein, was auch die Moral schwächt, da die Männer das Gefühl haben, dass ihre Kameraden durch \"Neulinge\" ersetzt werden. In der Hoffnung, dies zu vermeiden, wurde die Idee einer freiwilligen Reservetruppe in Umlauf gebracht, die ausgebildet und bereit wäre, die durch Kampfhandlungen dezimierten regulären Einheiten zu verstärken."
 POL_Shield_of_the_Slavic_World: "Schild der slawischen Welt"
 POL_Shield_of_the_Slavic_World_desc: "Angesichts unserer jüngsten Geschichte unter den Stiefeln fremder Imperien kann es leicht passieren, dass wir unsere stolze Vergangenheit als eine der größten Militärmächte Osteuropas vergessen. Auch wenn wir immer noch nicht ganz die vergleichbare militärische Dominanz erreicht haben, die wir einst innehatten, so haben wir doch zumindest begonnen, diesen alten Geist wiederzuerlangen. Unsere Truppen marschieren heute erhobenen Hauptes und erinnern sich an den Grund, warum sie kämpfen, an die Idee, die sie vertreten, nämlich an ein Polen, das niemals wirklich besiegt werden wird."

 POL_Armia_Ludowa: "Armia Ludowa"
 POL_Armia_Ludowa_desc: "Władysław Sikorski is among the men who earned their combat experience in the Polish Legions during the Weltkrieg. Unlike some of his counterparts however, he has an ambitious vision for how the Polish army must operate during the next war. Rather than a conventional armed effort, his plan centres around a massive mobilisation of resources behind the military, pooling state and popular will into one effort to crush the enemy."
 POL_Unified_Command: "Unify the Command Structure"
 POL_Unified_Command_desc: "When waging a war with the total military and economic strength of the state behind it, it is vital to ensure that decisions on how to use it are made properly. While some call for simply centralising this control behind a single figure, Sikorski's proposal calls for the creation of bodies under the government capable of directing national resources properly and effectively, which would also prevent the army taking control of politics in such a time of crisis."
 POL_Reserve_System: "Establish a Reserve System"
 POL_Reserve_System_desc: "One of the major elements of the popular army concept is the usage of mass mobilisation of the population in the event of conflict. One of the first steps of this will be the establishing of a reserve system to manage and allocate forces effectively should the masses be called upon. This will also keep a list of all potential recruits and their economic necessity to minimise disruption to the logistical side of the military."
 POL_Economic_Mobilisation: "Military Self-Sufficiency"
 POL_Economic_Mobilisation_desc: "When the war comes, it is likely that we will be on our own. If we are to utilise this concept of a massive concentration of state resources properly, we must ensure that our military is not dependent on foreign suppliers for critical equipment. As part of this, there has been a great push to expand the domestic arms sector to produce for any of the key needs of the army."
 POl_Professional_Core: "Professional Core"
 POl_Professional_Core_desc: "While mass mobilisation is certainly the most dramatic part of Sikorski's reform plan, it is not the only element. He promotes the idea of a small, specialised core force, envisioning them as motorised and equipped with the best weaponry available. This would make them capable of being the spearhead of any operations, breaking difficult enemy units and filling a role almost comparable to shock troops."
 POL_Infantry_Tanks: "Doctrine of Infantry Tanks"
 POL_Infantry_Tanks_desc: "While the showy field of armoured warfare has won many proponents in recent years, this idea of exclusively tank warfare is seen as short sighted under the new vision for the Polish army. While tanks certainly have conditions where they can be useful, their high cost to build and operate makes them far less appealing than a capable infantry unit. To assist this vision, new tank designs are being proposed that rather than acting on their own, would support the infantry in the field."
 POL_Air_Defence_Squadrons: "Air Defence Squadrons"
 POL_Air_Defence_Squadrons_desc: "The aerial theatre of operations is core to the plan for a popular army. The first part of this is the creation of a fighter force which is capable of protecting our territory from airborne marauders sent by the enemy, rather than attacking them in their home turf. These fighters will be ready to meet the enemy when they arrive, and deter them from making such forays in the future."
 POL_Bomber_Force: "The Bomber Command"
 POL_Bomber_Force_desc: "Once national airspace has been secured by our fighter aircraft, the real work can begin for our aerial forces - bombing the enemy. This will involve the usage of multirole aircraft capable of attacking both enemy ground targets and key pieces of infrastructure and manufacturing which will cripple their ability to reinforce their troops when our ground forces start their attack."
 POL_Polish_Citizen-Soldier: "Polish Citizen-Soldier"
 POL_Polish_Citizen-Soldier_desc: "As the dividing line between civilian and soldier becomes increasingly blurred under the plans for a popular army, many have been keen to ask where the line actually is? The answer is simple: there is no such line. When the war comes, our citizens and soldiers will become one and the same, as the state itself is transformed into an instrument of war, one where every Pole is part of the fight in some form or another."
 POL_Unshakeable_Will: "The Unshakeable Will"
 POL_Unshakeable_Will_desc: "Thanks to Sikorski's reforms, we have succeeded in transforming our military and state into something entirely new. Every citizen of our nation can now feel like a part of the greater engine of national defence, all working to bring about complete and utter victory. When the time comes and we are all called upon, nothing will be left to waste - all will spring to their duty whether that be in the factories or on the frontlines. As one, we are unbreakable."

 POL_Election_of_1938: "Election of 1938"
 POL_Election_of_1938_desc: "The elections of 1938 are shaping up to be rather crucial, with many doubting the ability of the current government to survive in the face of rising opposition to their rule. This ranges from more socialist parties on the left, to staunch conservative forces on the right. It remains to be seen who will have their hands on the tiller when the ballots are counted, but it is certain they will shape Poland to their vision."

 POL_Revolutionary_Republic: "Revolutionary Republic"
 POL_Revolutionary_Republic_desc: "To the surprise of many in the political centre, the monarchy has crumbled and a new Polish Syndicalist Republic has risen from the rubble. The new government is still uncertain and will have to begin rapidly taking steps to entrench itself and begin transforming the old capitalist and German-dominated economy into one that is both socialist and Polish."
 POL_Workers_Economy: "Workers' Economy"
 POL_Workers_Economy_desc: "The economy of a syndicalist state is one which is supposed to be both run and controlled by the workers. For a nation such as ours, which has long been controlled by entrenched interests which worked against the average person, the economy is fundamentally unfair. Therefore, we will begin to create a system where the common workers will control the Polish economy."
 POL_Topple_the_Tyrants: "Topple the Tyrants"
 POL_Topple_the_Tyrants_desc: "While we have our external tyrants, there are many within our nation as well. From nobility to cruel landowners, much of our nation is controlled by unaccountable local dictators. While many have fled in the wake of the revolution, those that remain will be removed and the structural economic legacy they left will be torn down."
 POL_The_Myth_of_the_Revolution: "The Myth of the Revolution"
 POL_The_Myth_of_the_Revolution_desc: "As the initial dust begins to settle, the new Syndicalist nation stands at a crossroads. The coming weeks will force us to make many choices as to the form of our new republic - choices whose legacy will likely cast a shadow on Polish history for years, if not decades to come. A new Poland has been born and it remains to be seen what that will look like."

 POL_In_Zakrzewskis_Light: "In Zakrzewski's Light"
 POL_In_Zakrzewskis_Light_desc: "In the fight for dominance over the soul of the new republic, Zakrzewski's adherents of the committee has come out on top. They reject mere \"red-tinted liberalism\" and instead aim for greater national transformation under guidance of strong leader - Zakrzewski himself."
 POL_Sorelian_Doctrine: "Brzozowski-Sorelian Thought"
 POL_Sorelian_Doctrine_desc: "Two main influences behind Zakrzewski's philosophy are Georges Sorel and Stanisław Brzozowski. In their thinking, the Nation is composed of the workers, and only the workers. Those who leech off the fruits of labour of others are not Poles, but parasites."
 POL_Catholic_Social_Teaching: "Catholic Social Teaching"
 POL_Catholic_Social_Teaching_desc: "Catholicism is integral part of Polish identity, even if the Church is counter-revolutionary enemy. Through incorporation of Catholic social teaching and worker-priests this link does not need to be severed."
 POL_Moral_Syndicalism: "Moral Syndicalism"
 POL_Moral_Syndicalism_desc: "While syndicalism is traditionally seen as an economic model more than anything else, the writings of Sorel go into far more depth about how such a society should be structured. Syndicalism must include moral rejuvenation of the working class, who must represent the idealized man."
 POL_Proletarian_Nationalism: "Revolutionary Nationalism"
 POL_Proletarian_Nationalism_desc: "While many see the socialist struggle as an internationalist one between all of the proletariat, the reality is far more complicated. As the Italian Enrico Corradini wrote, there are also "Proletarian Nations" - ones which have been oppressed by the bourgeois powers of the world. Therefore, it is the necessity of these proletarian nations to overthrow their masters in order to be free, and all workers must dedicate themselves to this fight."
 POL_Pilsudskis_Vision: "Piłsudski's Vision"
 POL_Pilsudskis_Vision_desc: "While never a true syndicalist, Józef Piłsudski has become an idol for Zakrzewski and his followers, particularly adapting his ideas of an Intermarium into their goals for liberating the Eastern Europe as a whole from its oppressors. To them, issues such as language have little meaning compared to greater class struggle."

 POL_The_People_Must_Decide: "The People Must Decide"
 POL_The_People_Must_Decide_desc: "While the fear of the moment can make it tempting to centralise, to allow the iron fist to direct a nation in a time of crisis - to do this would make us no better than our enemies. If we want to show the world who we really are, what we stand for, we must allow the pluralistic side of the committee to flourish, planting the seeds of a democracy by and for the working class."
 POL_zakrzewski_ousted: "Chairman Zakrzewski's Dictatorship was averted."
 POL_Supreme_Chamber_of_Commerce: "The Supreme Chamber of Commerce"
 POL_Supreme_Chamber_of_Commerce_desc: "Founded in place of the Senate, the Supreme Chamber of Commerce functions as the syndicalist \"upper house\". Trade unions elect their representatives to this chamber. After all, who can lead the production better than the producers themselves? With this chamber, Zakrzewski's concept of \"organic labour democracy\" is one step more perfect."
 POL_Land_of_Free_Men: "Land of Free Men"
 POL_Land_of_Free_Men_desc: "Under the old liberal system, freedom focused on freedom for specific groups, dividing the classes into arbitrary groups to keep them weak. Under the new socialist system, all shall enjoy true freedom, the freedom to live and die as equal men, beyond the traditional divides in our society. While instilling this mindset in the average person will be difficult, we will show them how to care."
 POL_Peasant_Cooperatives: "Peasant Cooperatives"
 POL_Peasant_Cooperatives_desc: "While many look to the trade unionist systems in France and Britain as a model for the new nation, Poland is quite different from either of these examples. Our rural population has led to many proposing instead to encourage the growth of Peasant cooperatives which will be able to collectively elevate Peasant communities and break the traditional mindset of competition which kept them divided."
 POL_Healing_the_Scars: "Healing the Scars"
 POL_Healing_the_Scars_desc: "The old order thrived on division. The ability to keep the common man divided from his brothers was key in keeping him trapped in his chains. While we have made steps in waking people from this trance, there are still old grudges which will take more than a few statements to heal. If we can successfully foster further erosion of our traditional divides, we will create a stronger nation."
 POL_The_French_Model: "The French Model"
 POL_The_French_Model_desc: "As the two most successful Syndicalist states, it is only natural that they would set the example for future revolutions to follow. The kinks already worked out in Paris and London means that we don't have to figure it out as we go along, and while much of our nation is not as industrial as France or Britain, we can find workarounds for involving our rural population in the process."
 POL_Internationalism: "Embrace Internationalism"
 POL_Internationalism_desc: "Liberty does not speak one language and does not really represent one nation. While our nations may seem different, in reality our goals are identical - that being the desire for total liberty from oppression and subjugation. Unfortunately, there are still many who labour under oppression, and it is our duty as free peoples to end this gross injustice."

 POL_Equality_Triumphant: "Equality Triumphant"
 POL_Equality_Triumphant_desc: "Through our efforts, we have dismantled the systems of unfairness and injustice to their very foundations. The people of our nation now enjoy liberties almost unparalleled in the world, granting them personal, economic and religious freedoms which would have once seemed impossible. Though there is still much work to be done to better the lives of our people, we can know that in a time where many wish to undo freedoms and rights that we stand firm."
 POL_Red_Intermarium: "Red Intermarium"
 POL_Red_Intermarium_desc: "The peoples of Eastern Europe have long been oppressed by various masters, be they Russian, Austrian or German. The dream of Intermarium is one which would undo this. A cooperation of the region's peoples which would allow them to stand tall against imperialism. While many dismiss such ideas as unrealistic or idealistic, they once said the same about Syndicalism in Eastern Europe, and they will be proven wrong again."
 POL_Polish_Socialist_Republic: "Polish Socialist Republic"
 POL_Polish_Socialist_Republic_desc: "We must admit the facts - even if we incorporate our smaller neighbouring peoples into our nation with good intentions, we will be seen as the conquerors. A government that drags the Polish people into a war has already abandoned its primary duty - to improve the lives of the Poles."
 POL_Central_European_Commonwealth: "Central European Confederation"
 POL_Central_European_Commonwealth_desc: "What truly united the Commonwealth of old was the shared interests and loyalty: a desire to build a better tomorrow for everyone instead of mindless conquest that would only bring bloodshed. It is this path of cooperation that we must strive for if we are to see the old days of glory return."

 POL_Centrolew: "Ascension of the Centrolew"
 POL_Centrolew_desc: "In a grim turn for the pro-German elements in our nation, the Centrolew bloc has managed to secure a victory in the election. Falling to the left politically and economically, these parties envision an ambitious series of reforms to break up the status quo and strengthen democratic control over the nation's political direction. Their plans are also likely to involve further decoupling of Poland from the German economic hegemony and working closer with their brothers in Galicia."
 POL_centrolew_harder_warning: "§SThe Centrolew government decreases the possibility of a socialist revolution massively.§!"
 POL_Embrace_Secularism: "Embrace Secularism"
 POL_Embrace_Secularism_desc: "Key to the goal of a Poland which works for all her citizens is enshrining a nation where they will not be judged by their creed. To ensure that the state cannot be used to disadvantage those of other faiths, a wedge will be driven firmly between it and the church. While we have no issue with being religious in private, these are two spheres that should not interact, no matter what some in politics may demand."
 POL_Free_And_Secular_Education: "Free and Secular Education"
 POL_Free_And_Secular_Education_desc: "The youth represent the future of our nation, and while education in our nation has made incredible advances in recent years, there are still many who miss out because of economic or geographic circumstances. In a bid to rectify this failing, it has been proposed to offer free education to all who want it, using a curriculum which would be centrally managed to ensure all students are taught the same knowledge."
 POL_Enshrine_Minority_Rights: "Enshrine Minority Rights"
 POL_Enshrine_Minority_Rights_desc: "For the various religious and cultural minorities of Poland, the election of a new government does little to give them hope that discrimination against them will end, just because the current people in power are opposed to it. To prevent any progress we make in healing archaic divisions being undone by our successors, we will make steps to enshrine the rights of minorities in law."
 POL_Female_Suffrage: "Female Suffrage"
 POL_Female_Suffrage_desc: "The idea of womens' suffrage has spread rapidly across the world in recent decades, as women began to end their silence and demand equal rights to men. Through their activism they have managed to secure major victories in their struggle, with many nations in Europe granting women the right to vote. With more radical individuals in power, these calls finally have a voice in government: the time has come for Poland to join the liberal nations of the world and let women have their say."
 POL_Shackle_the_Senate: "Shackle the Senate"
 POL_Shackle_the_Senate_desc: "The upper house of the Sejm has proven itself to be the citadel of conservatism and reactionary thought, allying itself with the Germans rather than with the people of Poland. This archaic institution has one purpose: to slow down progress. In our ideal Poland such an elitist body would not exist, but for time being we can only reduce their influence in favour of the lower house."
 POL_Curtail_the_Geheimrat: "Curtail the Geheimrat"
 POL_Curtail_the_Geheimrat_desc: "The King's Privy Council is the very embodiment of unelected elites controlling the nation instead of the people of Poland. One way to restrict their influence is to curtail the membership to only true citizens of Poland, which would greatly reduce German influence over us."
 POL_Land_of_Peasants: "Land of the Peasants"
 POL_Land_of_Peasants_desc: "The majority of our nation belong to the class of relatively poor peasants who work hard and receive little thanks for their labour. Campaigning on a platform of expanding democracy and reforming archaic institutions, many within the government wish to centre programmes around making this nation one which is made by and works for the peasants via popular land reforms and attempting to better their economic prospects."
 POL_Create_The_Chamber_Of_Labour: "Create the Chamber of Labour"
 POL_Create_The_Chamber_Of_Labour_desc: "Believing the nascent urban working class to be the future of the Polish economy, there are many within the more urban cohort of our government who believe working to better their conditions should be core to our reforms. One of their first ideas to do this is to create a \"Chamber of Labour\", which would represent the interests of all workers in Poland and would fight to improve their circumstances."
 POL_Nationalise_Heavy_Industry: "Nationalise the Vital Sectors"
 POL_Nationalise_Heavy_Industry_desc: "While we do not entirely reject the free market like the far more radical syndicalists do, there are strong voices within our administration who believe that the government is the best to provide what they term \"vital industries\". This is broadly envisioned as being any industry deemed essential to the provision of basic goods or to national security. Many of these industries are currently dominated by industrialists, who are unlikely to be pleased with this plan."
 POL_Creation_of_Small_Farms: "Creation of Small Farms"
 POL_Creation_of_Small_Farms_desc: "There are many problems with the current distribution of land in our rural areas, and while many propose more cautious reform, such a programme would not do enough to eliminate the roots of the problem. Rather, many believe that a more total redistribution of the land is needed to create a fairer situation for peasants, taking it from those who own the land and giving it to those who actually use it."
 POL_Workers_Rights: "Secure Workers' Rights"
 POL_Workers_Rights_desc: "It is a fact of life that people need to work in order to have a comfortable life, a fact that gives employers an unfair degree of power over the conditions that they can demand their workers to be forced to endure. This is an area where the state actually has immense power to do good, using its sheer power to compel employers to display a minimum level of care towards their workers. This should hopefully limit accidents and deaths in our industrial sector."
 POL_National_Healthcare: "National Healthcare"
 POL_National_Healthcare_desc: "Medicine has made great strides in recent years, but unfortunately these developments do not reach all equally with disadvantages in areas often being unable to get equal treatment with the wealthy. Nobody should die simply because they were unable to afford healthcare or were unable to access it. The government will provide healthcare to all in our nation - a basic good to make our citizens' lives infinitely better."
 POL_Unionisation_of_Peasants: "Unionisation of the Peasants"
 POL_Unionisation_of_Peasants_desc: "While most think of unions as representing the interests of workers in grimy factories, farmers are just as capable of working together to represent their interests. To help our rural areas transition to a more representative system for their sector of the economy, the government will support the creation of unions for our peasants and farmers. After all, if they go on strike, who will provide the food the rich need to survive?"
 POL_Union_with_Krakow: "Union with Kraków"
 POL_Union_with_Krakow_desc: "Kraków, the old royal capital of Poland, lies just beyond our border along with the rest of Galicia. This origin of the partition is entirely artificial, enforced by Austrians and Germans rather than Poles. With the election of a more liberal government, there have been increased calls to unite with the region which has long been a shelter for democrats and republicans. This will not be easy, as any such union relies on the consent of Berlin and Vienna."
 POL_no_AH_war_tt: "The Austro-Hungarian Empire is §Rnot§! in civil war."
 POL_Nationalise_Infrastructure: "Nationalise the Infrastructure"
 POL_Nationalise_Infrastructure_desc: "Trains, roads and ports are all key parts of our nation's transport infrastructure. In spite of this importance, much of their maintenance is left to a chaotic myriad of groups, which has produced less than stellar results. It would be better for the state to step in and take direct management of key infrastructure in order to ensure resources are being directed for the greatest return for the people."
 POL_Thorough_Land_Reform: "Thorough Land Reform"
 POL_Thorough_Land_Reform_desc: "Land reform has been the key economic and social question for our nation, and it is one our government must attempt to solve as part of our more peasant-focused reforms. Our plan envisions a careful but comprehensive reform of land usage within our nation, which will allow many to actually access the land which they work so hard to make productive."
 POL_Peoples_Banks: "People's Banks"
 POL_Peoples_Banks_desc: "For many in our nation, access to loans and capital vital to improve their economic situation is very hard to come by. The reality is that many financial institutions are unwilling to lend to peasants. In a novel idea to solve this problem, the government has proposed a system of communal banking where members of a community would all contribute, and from which loans could be better provided, hopefully allowing greater access to cheap credit."
 POL_Democracy_and_Transparency: "Democracy and Transparency"
 POL_Democracy_and_Transparency_desc: "Democracy is not just something which can be enacted in laws, it is something which must be built up in the minds of the population. By making them think democratically, understanding and respecting civil and political liberties as core parts of their lives, they will be able to foster our democratic system into something which can exist organically with full consent from the people."
 POL_Unicameralism: "Unicameralism"
 POL_Unicameralism_desc: "While many liberal democracies operate on a bicameral system where a lower house must cooperate with an upper house of some form, this system serves as an extra degree of separation of the people from their government - something which is anathema to our beliefs. Therefore we will empower a single legislative body to make decisions in our nation, ensuring a direct line between voters and the policies of the government."
 POL_Sincere_Government: "Sincere People's Government"
 POL_Sincere_Government_desc: "A government must be more than simply a set of policies or men in offices - it is supposed to embody the beliefs of the majority and work for the people. While some may call it idealism, arguing that no democratic system can withstand the realities of governance, we will strive to prove them wrong by creating a government which works by and for the people."
 POL_Dawn_of_Progress: "The Dawn of Progress"
 POL_Dawn_of_Progress_desc: "Thanks to our efforts, we have totally overhauled the political and social makeup of Poland while not wholly abandoning the things which make us unique. Democracy is not always the most inspiring ideology and is frequently attacked by those seeking to make it seemed flawed, but we have shown that idealism still has its place. A new Poland has been created - a model for other democracies to follow."

 POL_Circle: "His Majesty's Cabinet"
 POL_Circle_desc: "Despite the determined attempts of the opposition, the Pro-German Circle has come out on top in the election. With their victory, it is likely that the ideas of strong, stable government will continue in the future, with the Circle attempting to strengthen the centre against increasingly powerful fringes and a careful reform of government institutions along the Circle's principles."
 POL_Empower_Geheimrat: "Empower the Geheimrat"
 POL_Empower_Geheimrat_desc: "The election was a concerning time for many of the more actively pro-German members of the King's inner circle, with genuine concerns of the opposition taking power. Now that their position has been confirmed for now, many are now pushing to strengthen their bonds with the King to ensure that the correct voices advise him on policy in the future."
 POL_Entrenched_Constitutionalism: "Entrenched Constitutionalism"
 POL_Entrenched_Constitutionalism_desc: "While we have significant disagreements with the more radical Centrolew, we do share their belief in reform of the legislative system, providing more power to the Sejm and putting these bodies in a more equal balance with the King. This will hopefully also win us support from more moderate Centrolew supporters who will support moderate reform over none at all."
 POL_Ally_with_Szlachta: "Ally the Szlachta"
 POL_Ally_with_Szlachta_desc: "As the party representing a more stable balance between expanding native representation and preserving the key institutions of our society, we are in a great position to align ourselves with more liberal members of the nobility. Their support will allow us to make inroads in rural areas while also hopefully winning us some concessions when the time comes to answer the question of land reform."
 POL_Fill_The_Railway_Gaps: "Fill the Railway Gaps"
 POL_Fill_The_Railway_Gaps_desc: "Our legacy as a mere province has left us with a rather chaotic rail network, with a lack of connections between our internal system and that of our neighbours. This hampers our ability to transport by rail and benefit from our very central location in the Reichspakt, with many routes simply going around Poland even if it adds extra distance to their journey. Solving this lack of connection could provide us with a lot of benefits economically and logistically."
 POL_Friends_in_Vienna: "Friends in Vienna"
 POL_Friends_in_Vienna_desc: "For many within Centrolew, Austria represents a far more comfortable middle ground as a trade partner, both thanks to being a traditional shelter for democrats, and also because it would not result in us becoming further tied to Berlin. With the pre-existing economic connections to Galicia, encouraging economic ties between us and Vienna would be in the interests of both nations."
 POL_Allies_in_Lewiatan: "Allies in Lewiatan"
 POL_Allies_in_Lewiatan_desc: "In an effort to avoid ceding any more economic leverage to Berlin, a group of Polish industrialists known as \"Lewiatan\" has proposed to slash Polish workers' protections and corporate taxes, so that Polish industry can compete from advantageous position compared to other Mitteleuropa markets."
 POL_Constitutionalist_Coalition: "The Constitutionalist Coalition"
 POL_Constitutionalist_Coalition_desc: "A truce has been made between the republicans and the monarchy. United in defence of Polish democracy, the moderates of both sides have agreed to form a surprise coalition to stem the radicalism from both sides, trying to maintain a careful balancing act."
 POL_coalition_broken_tt: "§cSocial Conservatives§! and §gAuthoritarian Democrats§! will leave the coalition."
 POL_Allies_in_Berlin: "Allies in Berlin"
 POL_Allies_in_Berlin_desc: "As the largest source of foreign investment in our economy, it is only natural that we should seek to further develop our ties with Germany. While some claim that this makes us more liable to suffer should the German economy experience spirals, they fail to argue how a Polish economy would be immune to such a crash. In addition, by proving ourselves to be such a reliable partner to Berlin, we will likely have a lot of persuasion from German business interests to stay that way."
 POL_Attract_German_Corporations: "Attract German Corporations"
 POL_Attract_German_Corporations_desc: "Thanks to our efforts to prove ourselves as a reliable investment location, we have received a lot of interest from large German conglomerates looking either to establish new operations, or expand already existing ones. These companies have the potential to provide a lot of indirect benefits to our economy, provided we can convince them to follow on from these probing inquiries."
 POL_Rule_by_Royal_Decree: "Rule by Royal Decree"
 POL_Rule_by_Royal_Decree_desc: "In issues of national concern, it is not useful nor \"noble\" to concern ourselves with matters of protocols, and encouraging the ambitions of men with no greater claim to their positions other than being voted into them. What is needed is a strong King who is willing to make the necessary decisions to ensure that his people enjoy prosperity and safety from mob rule."
 POL_Guarded_Democracy: "Guarded Democracy"
 POL_Guarded_Democracy_desc: "While democracy is a good on principle, not every man is mature and good enough to be trusted with decisions regarding their country. As Roman Dmowski often said, the Commonwealth of old squandered its might in democratic bickering and plotting. We must ensure that the Sejm will always stay on the right path, regardless of communist agitators and others who would see Poland subjugated again."
 POL_Unite_the_Poles: "Unite the Poles"
 POL_Unite_the_Poles_desc: "With Germany making indications that they are willing to move beyond the status quo that has prevailed since their victory in the Weltkrieg, many have proposed to lobby Berlin on the issue of Polish unity, specifically around Galicia. Should this proposal be accepted, it would represent a major change in the situation of all Poles and be a huge victory for our government."
 POL_Primacy_of_the_Sejm: "Primacy of the Sejm"
 POL_Primacy_of_the_Sejm_desc: "It is impossible for one man to rule alone, and the Sejm has already prove itself to be more than capable of handling some duties as loyal servants of the King. This delegation has continued to the point where the Sejm has functionally become the controlling body of government, and there are those proposing we formalise this relationship, while at the same time making it clear they will still work with powers bestowed by their Monarch."
 POL_Manage_the_Unions: "Manage the Unions"
 POL_Manage_the_Unions_desc: "While few dispute that Unions can play an important role in society, their noble idea is very liable to being infiltrated by elements which claim to represent the interests of the workers. In order to prevent our unions becoming corrupted, the government will mandate government-appointed officials be placed in key union positions, while at the same time having plants within the unions to cut out the rot before it can spread."
 POL_Royal_Academy_of_Arts: "Royal Academy of Arts"
 POL_Royal_Academy_of_Arts_desc: "It is important that the people remember that the King is their King, and cares about their culture and history. In an effort to demonstrate this fact, plans have been drafted to create a royal institution to foster the Arts, which will demonstrate the King's willingness to support Polish culture and arts."
 POL_Mitteleuropa_Ties: "In the Middle of Mitteleuropa"
 POL_Mitteleuropa_Ties_desc: "The Central Industrial Region, our new economic core, also has the potential to be an economic hub for the entirety of Mitteleuropa. By strengthening rail and industrial links between the Region and the rest of Eastern Europe, we have the potential to have a nexus of the entire half of the continent in our hands, on par with any of the great cities of Europe."
 POL_Secure_Magnates: "Secure the Magnates"
 POL_Secure_Magnates_desc: "The large estates of our nation serve as a key part of safeguarding Polish economic interests, in spite of their inefficiencies. While majority Polish, there are great estates controlled and populated by those who are not Poles. These estates have few friends and are often hated by Polish landowners due to claims of undercutting. To get these Magnates on our side, we will begin dismantling these non-Polish strongholds and transform them into proper Polish communities."
 POL_Abolish_The_Royal_Veto: "Abolish the Royal Veto"
 POL_Abolish_The_Royal_Veto_desc: "With the status of the Sejm as the primary governing force entrenched, there have been growing calls to abolish the ability for the King to veto any legislation he sees fit. Many criticise this both for the pure undemocratic nature of it, and because it makes little sense given the King has given up most of his other powers. With the agreement of the Palace, the government will finally abolish the veto and make the Sejm the sole law-making body in Poland."
 POL_Path_of_Least_Resistance: "The Path of Least Resistance"
 POL_Path_of_Least_Resistance_desc: "Through the efforts of the Circle, Polish politics have been reformed at a slow but steady place. A new balance between the King and the people has been struck, showing that monarchies are more than capable at adapting to changing circumstances around them. With the threats to the further left and right now on the backfoot thanks to decisive action, the centre has triumphed in Poland - an island of stability in stormy seas."

 POL_Christian_Conservatism: "Christian Conservatism"
 POL_Christian_Conservatism_desc: "With the rise of the more right-wing and nationalist elements of Polish politics, culminating in their recent seizure of power, Polish politics are likely to see a rapid shift towards a more traditional style of governance. The new government generally focuses on intertwining Polish nationalist beliefs, with the traditional dominance held by the Catholic Church in the nation, arguing the strength of one is directly proportional to the other."
 POL_Christian_Conservatism_warning: "§cEven as a monarchy, nationalist Poland will not necessarily be loyal to Germany.§!"
 POL_Cement_The_Churchs_Status: "Cement the Church's Status"
 POL_Cement_The_Churchs_Status_desc: "In one of the first moves of the new government to entrench its ideals, plans are being drafted to recognise the Catholic Church as the state religion of Poland. They argue that by formalising the status quo, they will recognise the important role the Church has played in preserving our Nation's spirit. While this is supported by many Catholics, it is looked upon fearfully by religious minorities, fearing it may entrench pre-existing discrimination by providing legal legitimacy."
 POL_Purge_Nationalist_Terrorists: "Purge the Nationalist Terrorists"
 POL_Purge_Nationalist_Terrorists_desc: "The nationalist elements within our nation are nothing but a danger, managing to convince Poles that opposing the rule of law is somehow in their best interests. This dangerous thought threatens to spread if not swiftly removed, lest it corrupt the entire nation. Eliminating these radical nationalists will help in moderating the discussion of independence, while hopefully removing a potential threat."
 POL_Outlaw_Austrian_Agents: "Outlaw the Austrian Agents"
 POL_Outlaw_Austrian_Agents_desc: "While there are many within our nation campaigning for some degree of separation from the Germans, not all of these have entirely pure motivations. Concern has been raised due to representatives who come from the Austrian Empire to the south. While these individuals claim to be entirely independent, their reliance on Galicia has not gone unnoticed - because of this, there are many who have begun calling to act on these potential saboteurs before they can undermine us."
 POL_Arrest_Socialist_Agitators: "Arrest the Socialist Agitators"
 POL_Arrest_Socialist_Agitators_desc: "The radicals of the left make big claims, ceaselessly ranting about the injustices of capitalism and what they claim is a positively feudal system. Worryingly, this talk appears rather popular among our lower classes, who seem to believe the idealistic portrayal of the Syndicalist societies in the West. It is important that we crack down on this talk quickly, before it can get even more out of control."
 POL_Christian_Trade_Unionism: "Christian Trade Unionism"
 POL_Christian_Trade_Unionism_desc: "The rabid preachers of the left like to place themselves as the sole representatives of workers' rights, a convenient brush to paint their opponents with. In reality, valuing human dignity and fairness are far more connected with the teachings of Christ than those of any intellectual. To prevent the corruption of our workers, we will encourage the creation of unions based on papal ideas - a system of neither capitalism nor syndicalism which will protect Catholic values."
 POL_Eliminate_Class_Divisions: "Eliminate Class Divisions"
 POL_Eliminate_Class_Divisions_desc: "The petty divisions of class are entirely arbitrary and pointless, created by others to divide one Pole from another. It doesn't take a syndicalist to see that this is not right. In our new Poland, we must work to erode and eventually destroy these divisions - a move which will both unite and strengthen our people, being able to work as one to counter their enemies abroad which would seek to exploit these divisions."
 POL_The_Christian_Coalition: "The Christian Coalition"
 POL_The_Christian_Coalition_desc: "Despite our disagreements with the Germans, they were right in one matter: monarchy is the natural social order of any Christian nation, and therefore the Polish Catholics should seek not to oppose, but to glorify the monarchy and its stand against godless socialism."
 POL_Reinforce_The_Parliamentary_System: "Reinforce the Parliamentary System"
 POL_Reinforce_The_Parliamentary_System_desc: "While our current parliamentary system has a lot of serious issues in the eyes of many in government, the more pragmatic can see the clear benefits of working through this flawed structure to provide our decisions with a much greater degree of legitimacy. Fostering a strong parliamentary system will also have the benefit of making the people feel truly engaged with our policies, giving them a more bottom-up feeling of power."
 POL_Slay_Hydra_of_Capitalism: "Slay the Hydra of Capitalism"
 POL_Slay_Hydra_of_Capitalism_desc: "Recent decades have seen multinational capitalist systems dominating the global order. These structures, sold as positive and equal, in reality serve to exploit the weakest peoples and nations by pre-existing controllers. If we do not reverse this course, we will all be subordinate to foreign markets, and our nation's will would effectively be nullified. Despite the challenges, we must fight against this hegemony, so our nation will stand when the markets bring all others tumbling down."
 POL_The_Marshal: "First Marshal of Poland"
 POL_The_Marshal_desc: "Edward Rydz-Śmigły has taken up the mantle of Marshal of Poland, the supreme leader and protector of the nation. He has carefully fostered this aura around himself of being an embodiment of the Polish nation, commanding it as he would any military unit. Now at the helm of the nation, his policies will likely focus on entrenching this image and correcting the \"alien\" elements of the population."
 POL_Party_of_National_Unification: "The Party of National Unification"
 POL_Party_of_National_Unification_desc: "The challenges facing our state require a united political front against our enemies: the petty divisions of conventional politics simply distract and undermine our struggle. We must further strengthen the image of the OZN as a party which all Poles must support. Campaigns will be mounted against those who attempt to denigrate and attack the noble aims of our party. Their gossip will not be tolerated."
 POL_Centralisation_of_Power: "Centralisation of Power"
 POL_Centralisation_of_Power_desc: "Despite our efforts to counter division and squabbling, many refuse to keep with the programme. It has become clear that the people cannot be relied on to act in their best interests. We must demonstrate to them that the united and uncompromising state, guided firmly by its leader, is the only way to bring Poland into a brighter tomorrow. Through intense propaganda efforts and a regulation of dangerous thought, we will make this united nation a reality."
 POL_Saviour_of_Poland: "The Saviour of Poland"
 POL_Saviour_of_Poland_desc: "Thanks to the efforts of Rydz-Śmigły, the enemies of the Polish people are slowly being driven out. The regime has been building up the image of the Marshal as a guiding hand, taking the reins of a nation heading to ruin, and setting us back on the right course. It is important the people of Poland never forget this deed, and new laws are being proposed which would require portraits to be placed in all public buildings across the nation. A small thanks for his noble effort."
 POL_Corporatism: "Corporatism"
 POL_Corporatism_desc: "The economic and social sectors have long been framed as being pitted against each other, all competing for resources and money. This destructive child of Liberalism serves to do nothing but breed division and discontent. In the new Poland, a more harmonious economic model is envisioned, modelled on the principles of corporatism. Rather than competing, the separate economic sectors will be mandated to work in tandem, like the individual organs of the creature that is the economy."
 POL_Social_Altruism: "Social Altruism"
 POL_Social_Altruism_desc: "Through the previous damage of the free market, many have managed to slip below the cracks and now live in abject poverty. Embracing the Christian ethos of charity and alms-giving, we will aim to alleviate their suffering, providing them with the basic requirements needed to live life as God wished them to. This goodness should hopefully make the lives of the poor better, while also show it is not godless syndicalists who value the lives of the unfortunate, but all good Christians."
 POL_Managed_Land_Reform: "Managed Land Reform"
 POL_Managed_Land_Reform_desc: "While solving the issue of unequal land distribution is obviously one which must be solved to allow our people to prosper, we must be careful to not capsize the boat when trying to change tack. Any radical action like that envisioned by other reformers would only alienate landowners and do greater damage in the long run. Therefore, we must engage in careful and fair distribution of land assets, properly compensating any who lose their property."
 POL_Polonisation_Programs: "Polonisation Programmes"
 POL_Polonisation_Programs_desc: "It is unfair that in a nation of Poles, it is often those not of native blood that control significant amounts of our nation. These minorities keep to themselves, extracting wealth from our nation and people. We must take firm action to eliminate these groups, either through integration into Polish culture or through a destruction of their power and social cliques. After all, there are already nations for Germans or Ukrainians: Poland should be for the Poles."
 POL_First_of_Slavs: "The First of the Slavs"
 POL_First_of_Slavs_desc: "While we are obviously firmly committed to the ideals of liberty for all Slavs, we cannot let such a cause come at the expense of our own nation's right to prosper. We must work to create the ideal Polish nation before we go about trying to assist in the liberation of our Eastern brothers, some of whom directly oppose the goals of a strong and defendable Poland. Once our people are reunited again under our banner, the Polish eagle will soar high across the East once again."
 POL_Catholic_State: "True Catholic [POL_Government]"
 POL_Catholic_State_desc: "Through our efforts, we have turned the Church from something increasingly marginalised into a core pillar of our state. Across the nation, our people slowly rediscover not just their patriotism, but their faith. The strong ties between Rome and Warsaw will never be broken, and we can only hope that his Holiness will be willing to return our faithfulness in the future. A brighter, more moral future is about to begin for the true sons and daughters of Poland."
 POL_Exceptional_Individual: "The Exceptional Individual"
 POL_Exceptional_Individual_desc: "According to Adam Doboszyński, every generation has their exceptional individuals, and those persons must take a guiding role in completely reforging the Polish national identity into one which does not strongly connect to the Church, but actively implements their ideas for social, political and economic organisation."
 POL_postwar_coup: "Poland was freed by Russians"
 POL_Liberation_of_Greater_Poland: "The Liberation of Greater Poland"
 POL_Liberation_of_Greater_Poland_desc: "Greater Poland is the home of our movement, the stronghold which has never surrendered to the German yoke, despite the Prussian attempts to eradicate their culture for the past century. New Poland can only be born with Poznań!"
 POL_Root_Out_Those_Without_Faith: "Root Out Those Without Faith"
 POL_Root_Out_Those_Without_Faith_desc: "There are many in our nation who do not hold the true teachings of Christ close to their heart, either holding alternate interpretations or ignoring his word completely. In the first steps of our new state, we must eliminate these elements if we wish to succeed in our mission to transform the Polish nation. While this move will likely be very unpopular, it will likely break the power of religious minorities to ignore the word of God."
 POL_Handle_the_Rydz_Clique: "Handle the Rydz Clique"
 POL_Handle_the_Rydz_Clique_desc: "The cult build up around Piłsudski and his successors are a potent political force, one which if left unchecked could easily come to overpower and dominate our own. While we have the upper hand at present, this will not necessarily always remain the case, particularly given their influence on the military. In order to secure our state, we must completely remove these circles from the political equation going forward."
 POL_End_Army_Factionalism: "End Army Factionalism"
 POL_End_Army_Factionalism_desc: "Too long has our military been divided along political lines, over ideological squabbles over Piłsudski's \"true\" vision. No more! The factionalists must go - and proper moral education must be taken into officer curriculum to ensure our unity."
 POL_The_Monoidea: "The Monoidea"
 POL_The_Monoidea_desc: "Years of corruption by the market and western notions has led to a general fouling of the Catholic and pure nature of our people. Germans and Russians have managed to convince them that they are somehow different from each other. We must take steps to purge these thoughts, reinstating the brotherhood of all Christians, before the foreign elements of our nation are able to exploit these schisms and completely overpower us."
 POL_Hijack_Endecja: "Hijack the Endecja"
 POL_Hijack_Endecja_desc: "For our movement to succeed, our best strategy is to appeal to National Democracy's core. By stressing the importance of Catholicism and traditional values, we can sway their supporters behind our cause."
 POL_Hijack_Endecja_tt1: "Convert §cSocial Conservative§! and §NNational Populist§! popularity into §PPaternal Autocrat§! popularity."
 POL_Hijack_Endecja_tt2: "Convert §cSocial Conservative§! and §PPaternal Autocrat§! popularity into §NNational Populist§! popularity."
 POL_Hijack_Endecja_tt3: "Convert §cSocial Conservative§!, §PPaternal Autocrat§! and §NNational Populist§! popularity into your ruling ideology."
 POL_Moral_Planning: "Moral Planning of Society"
 POL_Moral_Planning_desc: "Many forget that societies are based on the behaviour of those within them, and in the eyes of many, the answers as to what \"good\" character actually is, can be found within the pages of our scripture, with most teachings on how to arrange society in a manner directed by God himself being found. We will work to integrate the teachings of the Church into government discussions and policy going forward, allowing it to safeguard our morals once again."
 POL_Land_For_All: "Land For All"
 POL_Land_For_All_desc: "The peasant family is the cornerstone of the Christian nation: without them there would be nothing. Every famnily should have their own plot of land, and their own means of subsistence, without being dependent on the whims of a land-owner or an industry capitalist."
 POL_National_Distributism: "National Distributism"
 POL_National_Distributism_desc: "The philosophy of distributism is a major lever against socialism, allowing us to provide the broadest level of prosperity while not destroying the things that keep our nation holy. By implementing these principles of industrial decentralisation and cooperatives, which would prevent the exploitative practices of Socialism or Capitalism damaging our nation in the future, Workers in the future will work together as human beings, not as members of some class."
 POL_Small-Scale_Production: "Small-Scale Production"
 POL_Small-Scale_Production_desc: "As an example of economic decentralisation, we must strike at the mining industry. Too long the mines have profited only the small amount of capitalist elite. Every village will be encouraged to smelt the metals for their own tools, as part of great reclaimation of work from the capitalists and socialists."
 POL_Union_of_Western_Slavs: "Unity of the Western Slavs"
 POL_Union_of_Western_Slavs_desc: "While the Western Slavs are often a disparate people, who we have admittedly had strong disagreements with in the past, we are still related to some degree or another. It is because of this that calls are increasing to formalise our unity with other Slavic nations, showing that while we may frequently have our disagreements, we will always resist those who attempt to confiscate the liberty of us all."
 POL_Towards_Great_Nation: "Towards the Great Nation"
 POL_Towards_Great_Nation_desc: "The reforms begun by our government are only the beginning, paving the way for our nation and its morals to rise as a beacon to other Christian states, proving that existing in the modern world does not require abandoning your god or your morality to bring about prosperity. We can only hope other nations will soon see the light as we have, as we are currently the only cutting edge of the Christian movement worldwide."
 POL_Total_Catholicism: "Total Catholicism"
 POL_Total_Catholicism_desc: "Ultimately Poland will be organised according to Catholic principles and Catholic principles only. This total form of national Catholicism was referred to as \"Totalizm\" in Doboszyński's earlier writings, until Mosley and his cronies hijacked the term into their godless socialist narrative. If our enemies are total in their devotion to the Revolution, we must be even more total in our dedication to Catholic Poland."

 POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy: "Rebirth of the Polish Fleet"
 POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy_desc: "Now that our nation has finally reconnected with the sea, we must make sure to defend our access to it. The established naval powers are likely to try and domineer us if we do not act quickly, and so proposals have been created for the creation of a Polish Navy - our first real naval force since the 17th century. While our initial ships and officers are unlikely to change the world, they will be the first steps for a new branch of the Polish armed forces with a lot to prove."
 POL_german_ships_tt: "A handful of formerly German ships will be transferred to our control."
 POL_Grand_Shipyard_of_Gdansk: "Grand Shipyard of Gdańsk"
 POL_Grand_Shipyard_of_Gdansk_desc: "The port of Gdańsk was a major centre during German rule, and will likely continue to remain so now that it has been liberated. With our nascent fleet still in great need of more ships, there will be significant opportunities for the shipyards of the city to expand further, turning it into not just the principal port for Poland, but also a major entrepot for the entire Baltic - facilitating significant trade thanks to its river connections with the rest of Eastern Europe."
 POL_Maritime_and_Colonial_League: "Maritime and Colonial League"
 POL_Maritime_and_Colonial_League_desc: "The birth of modern global economies means that accessing vital resources often depends on being able to cross vast oceans. In order to manage all seaborne trade back to our shores, we will create a proper merchant navy, which will ensure that our industry gets whatever products and resources from overseas that it may need."
 POL_Establish_Admiralty: "Establishment of the Admiralty"
 POL_Establish_Admiralty_desc: "While the first forays of the navy in safeguarding our maritime area have been broadly decent, relying on this approach in the future will make our navy an inefficient laughing stock. Like virtually all naval forces in the world, we will establish an admiralty to concentrate our naval talent, and plan how to properly allocate naval forces. This should hopefully allow us to function better as a united force rather than as a collection of ships."
 POL_Ship_Acquisitions: "Ship Acquisitions"
 POL_Ship_Acquisitions_desc: "What we need is raw numbers, and we needed them yesterday. We can solve this problem by looking to purchase surplus vessels from abroad which have outlived their usefulness for their former users. Many of these vessels can still somewhat compete however, and with a little bit of renovation and refitting, we will have ourselves a reasonably competent naval force for the moment, which matters far more than having the most modern ships at sea in the future."
 POL_Protection_of_Baltic: "Protect the Baltic"
 POL_Protection_of_Baltic_desc: "Unlike many other nations, we are somewhat lucky to be positioned on the Baltic - a sea which provides fewer advantages to the giant naval forces which dominate the oceans. In this inland sea, skirmish forces can prove very effective at harassing and driving off larger forces. This has led to proponents of a surface fleet pushing for the creation of a force of destroyers and minelayers, which would make any capital force wary of getting too close to our shores."
 POL_Hunt_and_Harass: "Hunt and Harass"
 POL_Hunt_and_Harass_desc: "Unlike many other nations, we are somewhat lucky to be positioned on the Baltic - a sea which provides fewer advantages to the giant naval forces which dominate the oceans. The few ways to escape from this sea make it perfect for using raiders and submarines, which can trap and annihilate unsuspecting forces. This line of thought is espoused by proponents of a more proactive naval stance, which will actively attack those foolish enough to try and sail their vessels on the Polish lake."
 POL_Marriage_to_the_Sea: "Marriage to the Sea"
 POL_Marriage_to_the_Sea_desc: "As our fleet continues to flourish, many have brought up the old idea of a \"marriage to the sea\" - a partnership which the newly founded navy should hopefully be able to defend. Partly as a genuine strategic belief and partly as a statement of national prestige, there are those who call for the construction of a flagship for the Polish navy. A vessel which would stand as a monument to our connection to the sea, one which will never be broken again."

### Ideas ###
 POL_professional_army: "Professional Army"
 POL_professional_army_desc: "Poland's army is based on the Polish Legions and the Polish Auxiliary Force that were formed under Austro-German command during the war. \"Unruly\" German officers are commonly dispatched to Poland, where the force is used as testing grounds for equipment the German high command is uncertain - or even disdainful - of.

The last two decades have created bitter rifts between supporters and opponents of the King, as well as the larger debate about Germany's true place in Poland. On the fringes of politics, socialists and nationalists fiercely oppose each other, despite the ever-present threat of German domination. This is reflected everywhere - entrepreneurs and landowners covertly lend their support to pro- or anti-German societies, while unions everywhere stoke pro-socialist tensions, with strikes regularly forming and being disbanded by the military police."

Limited land reform has been tried, failing to produce results, largely due to government indecision and lack of funds.

They can be appeased through parliamentarism and the enactment of liberal policies, while authoritarianism will radicalise them further. Politically, they are aligned with the §lPSL§! and §SPPS§!, making up the \"Centrolew\" bloc.\n\nThe §tSocialists§! represent the radical revolutionaries, who seek to go further and overthrow the entire bourgeois system. They can be appeased by pro-worker legislation and fighting foreign economic control, and will be angered by the inverse. Politically, they are aligned with the §RPPS-Left§! and other §ofar-left organisations.§!\n\nThe §nNationalists§! represent a myriad nationalist groups under the broad banner of Roman Dmowski's spiritual leadership. While they have no real love for the monarchy, they can work with it as long as their Christian-nationalist policies are implemented and the left are opposed. They are angered by liberal and leftist policies, but also by excessive authoritarianism - if it takes power away from Poles themselves.

However, many of their supporters can still be appeased with social democratic policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the §nNationalists§! are the greatest opposition to our new republic.

While we will inevitably have to defeat them by force, maintaining elements of the parliamentary system may take the wind from their sails.\n\nMeanwhile, the §tSocialists§! are possibly even more bold than in the past, as their arch-enemies now sit in the government.

### Events ###
 poland.0.t: "The Kingdom of Poland"
 poland.0.d: "Two decades ago, thousands of Poles fought and died for the Central Powers. This stormy cooperation with two of the three former partitioning powers led to the creation of the Kingdom of Poland, a nation which was a compromise from the beginning, carved out of former Russian territory. The hoped unification with Austrian Poland was denied early on, as Germany sought to wrest Poland from the Austrians and ensure free reign over the so-called \"Grenzmark.\" The Germans even annexed the so-called \"Frontier Strip\", with the aim for further colonisation, but it was returned after the fall of the Ludendorff dictatorship, leaving Poles forever doubtful of German intentions. Out of the original German ambitions merely a few things remain - King August IV's shaky rule and the professional, Prussian-drilled \"Polnische Wehrmacht.\"\n\nAgainst all odds, the Kingdom has survived and managed to find relative prosperity. Formerly the most industrialised region of the Russian Empire, Poland has greatly benefitted from its membership in Mitteleuropa, and economic cooperation with its neighbours, as both German and Austro-Hungarian investment has brought work and growth to Polish cities. King August IV's moderately liberal policies and willingness to honour the Polish constitution has won him some support over the years, but under the surface, grave issues are deepening.\n\nPoland, like most of Eastern Europe, is still a very agrarian nation. The divide between the growing cities and the countryside, which is largely owned by German and Polish nobility, has only grown during the years, forming a mass of landless, unemployed poor that are yearning for change. These social issues feed into the political radicalisation taking place on both sides of the political spectrum. The traditionally strong Polish left is well-organised, and has allied itself with the liberal-agrarian parties, calling for democratisation, land reform and even for a republic. Socialist organisations continually clash with far-right groups, who draw their support base from anti-German and anti-Semitic sentiment. All three anti-monarchist factions agree only on one thing: the destruction of the Kingdom and the removal of its Hohenzollern monarch... even if it means that much blood has to be shed."
 poland.0.a: "Tell us more about these German and\nAustrian interests."
 poland.0.b: "Enough reading."

 poland.1.t: "The Chessboard of Two Kaisers"
 poland.1.d: "Poland is much less under German influence than it may seem at first glance - even though the King is Wilhelm II's son, there is little love shared between them. August IV, a lover of arts and culture, has left much of the ruling to his government and his Geheimrat, composed of German, Austrian and Polish men of great importance, such as industrial magnates and military personnel. It is this council where, in seeking the King's favour, a game of political intrigue is played. The most influential voice for now belongs to Wolfgang von Kries, a military man of great experience and an often-seen ensurer of German military interests in Poland.\n\nVon Kries heads the German Military Mission to Poland, tasked with the oversight and training of the Polish army. It has become very much a project of Heinz Guderian, who has been slowly moulding the Polish army into his vision of a modern, mechanised elite force. Germany also owns the KKWP, the state railway company, securing its connection to the Oststaaten further in the East.\n\nThe Poles have constantly relied on Austrian support in keeping the Germans at arm's length. The Danubian states have a visible influence in Polish public life, with the szlachta's connections to Austrian aristocracy, Czech investments in Polish industry and the pro-Austrian rhetoric of many of the liberal politicians. It is no secret that Austria actively seeks to strengthen its position in Poland, and many Poles believe it will finally rid them of an overbearing Germany. Berlin, however, remains wary, as Poland's strategic location between them and the East is a matter of national security."
 poland.1.a: "And the anti-monarchist factions?"

 poland.2.t: "The Republican Movement"
 poland.2.d: "The so-called Polish republican movement is composed from left- and centre-liberal radicals, generally aligned to the opposition \"Centrolew\" bloc, formally known as the People's Union for Defence of Law and Freedom. While the Centrolew parties, the PSL and PPS, officially recognise the monarchy, and have even formed the government in the past, it is no secret that many among their ranks would rather see the German King deposed and a new, progressive republic declared. They are the largest and the most influential anti-monarchist bloc, enjoying great support both in Poland proper, and across the Galician border, where their popularity is even higher with Galician Poles, who see the republican cause as the path towards unification of the Polish people.\n\nFortunately for us, the republican movement is the least militant of our internal divisions, and their supporters believe in a more passive resistance and peaceful protesting. They are also willing to work within the system to some degree, as long as the King continues his path of constitutionalism and democracy. However, should we use harsh measures against them, it is more than probable that many of their supporters would radicalise further and turn towards more extreme ideas."
 poland.2.a: "They seem harmless enough, what about the other two?"

 poland.3.t: "The Revolutionary Committee"
 poland.3.d: "The Polish Socialist Party was the vanguard of the struggle of Polish liberation in 1905 and later during the Weltkrieg, uniting many of Piłsudski's colleagues under their revolutionary paramilitary organisations. Even though the party still hosts a radical, revolutionary wing, its leadership has walked the moderate path and wields considerable influence in the Sejm. However, within its unofficial sphere, many syndicalist trade unions and left-wing paramilitaries thrive.\n\nThe revolutionary movement is no doubt directed mainly from Paris, where many of the Polish syndicalists and anarchists have escaped under the wing of the so-called \"Revolutionary Committee\" of Kazimierz Zakrzewski. It is with Communard support that their tentacles corrupt Poland and guide its proletariat towards a more destructive path. There is little we can do to save the souls of the true believers, but the path of economic and social reforms should make their agitation ring hollow to the Polish working class."
 poland.3.a: "Where there's the far-left, I'm sure\nthere's also..."

 poland.4.t: "The National Committee"
 poland.4.d: "The Polish National Committee, formed by the Entente as their puppet government for Poland during the Weltkrieg, has not given us peace even after all these years. Their leader, Roman Dmowski, is himself in exile in Moscow, but still holds enormous sway over the Polish right. Even now while his National Democrats are pushed to the political fringe, it is no secret that many still feel loyalty towards him.\n\nThe far-right can be broadly divided into two factions - the conservative nationalists, who are willing to begrudgingly work with us, but would not hesitate to stab us in the back if it meant complete independence for Poland - and the radical nationalists such as ONR.\n\nThese ultranationalists are responsible for dozens of attacks against our government and their political enemies, taking their tactics from the eastern savages like Codreanu and Savinkov. They are vehemently anti-German, anti-Semitic, anti-establishment and beyond redemption. However, the more moderate nationalists can be satisfied, as long as our policies prove that we are not sacrificing Poland's Catholic, conservative nature to the whims of the socialists and the liberals."
 poland.4.a: "The Russian bootlickers can stay in Moscow."

 poland.5.t: "King August addresses the Sejm"
 poland.5.d: "Normally preferring to avoid involving himself in the day-to-day politics of the Kingdom, it came as a surprise when August IV, King by God's Grace, expressed his wish to address the Chamber of Deputies of the Sejm directly.\n\nToday, the King spoke in front of the 128 Deputies on the crisis currently engulfing the nation. His demeanour was calm and compromising, as he spoke of his responsibility to do his best for the well-being of all Poland. With unemployment skyrocketing and political violence surging to heights unseen in two decades, His Majesty's responsibility is to decide which path to follow.\n\nAugust's words seek compromise and non-partisanship, but many feel like they hold a veiled threat: either the elected government handles the crisis, or failing that, the King may turn to the less democratic means often pushed by his German advisors. Regardless of their loyalties, something everyone can agree with is the core of the King's speech - drastic measures must be taken."
 poland.5.a: "Onwards!"

 poland.6.t: "The Future of the Geheimrat"
 poland.6.d: "The King's Privy Council, called the Geheimrat in the German tradition, has come to wield considerable influence in the Kingdom, primarily because of one reason: the King listens to his councillors and is ready to act on their advice. There has always been a competition over the much-desired seats in his council, with important men vying for the chance of getting the King's ear. For a long time, August's most trusted advisor has been venerated General von Kries, who has been a staunch supporter of deep cooperation with Germany and the Heer.\n\nThe current crisis has caused many of the councillors to be questioned, and the King is expected to appoint new men in their position - ones who can truly guide the nation through the crisis, a job the old council proved inadequate to do."
 poland.6.a: "A good relationship with Germany is of upmost importance."
 poland.6.b: "Appointing more Austrians would give us a longer leash."
 poland.6.c: "Appointing more Polish nobles would buy the szlachta's support."

 poland.7.t: "The 24th Congress of the Polish Socialist Party"
 poland.7.d: "The Polish Socialist Party convened today in the old fortress city of Radom to elect number of new delegates into the Central Workers' Committee, which makes up the party's leadership. Many feel that the choice of city is highly symbolic, with the date nearing the 75th anniversary of the January Uprising, reminding everyone of how long the city had stood against the Tsarist armies. One can quickly notice the increased police presence in the streets of the well-preserved Medieval city centre, as the members of the PPS gather together from all around the Kingdom.\n\nSome old delegates, such as Mieczysław Niedziałkowski, one of the men behind building the Centrolew alliance, have announced their retirement from political life. Under his guidance, the PPS's direction has been towards moderation and reformism, seeing the united opposition front as the best method of influence. There are two men generally seen as his successors - another moderate Centrolew politician, Norbert Barlicki, and Niedziałkowski's personal friend and Barlicki's protégé, the more radical Stanisław Dubois.\n\nThe right wing of the party, wishing deepened ties with the PSL, has thrown their support behind Barlicki's faction, who is also a former PSL member. However, there is an ever-growing left wing feeling that the party leadership has betrayed their supporters by restricting \"truly revolutionary\" action, and that the PPS must return to its roots - personified in Dubois, a young orator and a tireless supporter of strike action as the weapon of the proletariat.\n\nNeedless to say, the upcoming vote will decide the direction of the PPS for years to come."
 poland.7.a: "Keep the current course."
 poland.7.b: "The left wing of the party takes power."
 poland.7.barlicki_tt1: "Moderate §YNorbert Barlicki§! will take control of the PPS."
 poland.7.barlicki_tt2: "Moderate §YNorbert Barlicki§!, supported by Austria, will take control of the PPS."

 poland.7.dubois_tt2: "Radical §RStanisław Dubois§!, supported by France, will take control of the PPS."

 poland.8.t: "Piłsudski's Legacy"
 poland.8.d: "One year ago Józef Piłsudski died in Warsaw, having spent his last decades in retirement and unofficial house arrest. Thousands of people have gathered today to pay homage to the idolised Polish patriot, visiting his grave, and those of many other fallen heroes of Poland's war of liberation. While pro-German elements and the King himself prefer to paint the national hero first and foremost as the leader of anti-Russian struggle, it is obvious that he is also seen as the hero of anti-German struggle.\n\nIn stark contrast to the waning popularity of the King, Piłsudski's memory seems to unite Poles across the political spectrum - even those among the military idolise him. Even if officially it is simply a matter of honouring past heroes, this visible occasion of Polish patriotism does show how little loyalty that the Germans have inspired. Piłsudski's final gift to Poland was a reminder to the Germans: they were foreigners ruling over Poles - they might have their loyalty for now, but if the Empire were ever to show weakness, there would be hell to pay."
 poland.8.a: "Let them honour him."
 poland.8.b: "Restrict the gatherings."

#Peasant unrest event chain
 poland.9.t: "Bitterness Among the Peasants"
 poland.9.d: "The south-eastern parts of Poland, such as the deeply agrarian Lublin and Siedlce voivodeships, have long been bastions of the radical People's Party and frequent hotbeds of peasant unrest. This so-called Małopolska, the Lesser Poland, has been hit hard by economic hardship, which has escalated the already strong bitterness of unequal land ownership into full-blown resistance. The PSL has boldly taken up the mantle as defender of the peasants, building a cult of strong Polish peasants as the truest expression of Polishness.\n\nA few days ago the PSL, along with some peasants' organisations, announced a number of marches and demonstrations in the countryside to pressure the government to see their plight. At this point their posturing is hardly a break from the ordinary, but it is still highly disruptive to the economy."
 poland.9.a: "Let the fools demonstrate."
 poland.9.b: "Send in the cavalry."

 poland.10.t: "The Great Peasant Strike"
 poland.10.d: "The situation in Lesser Poland has escalated quickly, after the PSL announced a nationwide peasant strike. The Peasant Order Guard, the PSL's militia, has taken control of roads around Lublin, Siedlce, Sandomierz and Chełm, stopping any deliveries of food into the cities. Reports state that many experienced strike organisers have travelled from far to join the PSL's struggle for the peasant's cause.\n\nThe demands are outrageous - nothing less than dismissal of the Royal Government, release of the political prisoners, land reform and social welfare, and even calls for abdication of the King. The protests quickly lost their peaceful nature as the peasant militias started beating government strike-breakers and attacking their homes."
 poland.10.a: "Send in the police."
 poland.10.b: "Negotiate with the demonstrators."

 poland.11.t: "The PPS Declares Solidarity Strike"
 poland.11.d: "The Polish Socialist Party, which had stayed silent until now, has finally announced their support for the Great Peasant Strike, and has joined the strike action with their considerable sway over the urban population. With the PPS on their side, the peasant strike has more or less crippled the entire nation, with both the peasants and industrial workers demanding reforms in unison.\n\nThe urban strikes have not gathered the same wide support as they have in the countryside, with many unions expressing worry about the peasant protester's policy of withholding food shipments to cities. We could use this mistrust between the urban and rural protesters to find a compromise with the PPS."
 poland.11.a: "Do not hesitate to use force."
 poland.11.b: "Compromise with the unions."

 poland.12.t: "Negotiations with the Revolters"
 poland.12.d: "The government has opened negotiations with the peasant committees and the PSL leaders. The starting situation feels hopeless, as the protesters' demands are truly outrageous. After days of back-and-forth, some progress has been made. The PSL leadership has agreed to drop some of their more radical claims such as dismissal of the government, and our negotiators have managed to convince them of the need of compromise in the land issue.\n\nWe could stand true to our promises and take the betterment of the countryside as our priority, even if many of our wealthy upper-class supporters will not like it. Alternatively, we can simply stall the negotiations and send in the cavalry to dispel the demonstrations."
 poland.12.a: "Fulfil some of their demands."
 poland.12.b: "Stall the negotiations and send in the police."

 poland.13.t: "Great Peasant Uprising in Poland" #for GER
 poland.13.d: "A nationwide wave of peasant protests has broken out in Poland, and the events have caused some unrest even in the Prussian side of the border in Masuria, and among the smallholders of Posen.\n\nThe scale of the demonstrations are worrying, and should August IV's government fail to contain the rebels, the strike might turn into actual uprising against our interests. Many in his council have asked Berlin to instruct them on how to handle the crisis."
 poland.13.a: "Auwi has always been too soft on the Poles. Demand action!"
 poland.13.b: "Let August handle it the way he sees the best."
 POL_13_tt: "§RThis might radicalise the protesters even further.§!"

 poland.14.t: "Countryside in Chaos"
 poland.14.d: "\"Let the cities die! Long live the nationwide strike! They cannot arrest millions!\", screamed the protesters, as well-organised police units marched to break the roadblocks erected by the peasants. The situation quickly escalated into a fight, as a band of peasant militia would not disperse despite orders to do so - which led to the police opening fire, before the militiamen armed with sticks, knives and old guns could attack them. Fighting broke out, and the crowds started taking over police stations. The entirety of Lublin police was paralysed, with dozens of dead officers country-wide.\n\nMultiple calls for help were sent to Warsaw, pleading the King to send in the military... or should we want to keep our hands a little less bloody, send in the German units under a pretext of protecting German-owned properties."
 poland.14.a: "Fine, dispatch the military police."
 poland.14.b: "Ask for German support."

 poland.15.t: "Poland Requests Aid"
 poland.15.d: "The Polish government has asked us to dispatch reinforcements to their police force, which has become exhausted and undermanned after a week of fighting the peasant uprising in Lesser Poland.\n\nWe could send a few units of well-equipped and trained Prussian policemen and strike-breakers to protect the German-owned properties in the region - and at the same time naturally help the Polish police contain the situation."
 poland.15.a: "Naturally - this is a matter of German security, too."
 poland.15.b: "Can't they even keep their own peasants in line?"

 poland.16.t: "Peasant Strikes Crushed Violently"
 poland.16.d: "This time the pacification operations were successful. Reinforced police units broke through the roadblocks and started dispersing the crowds by shooting. Peasants and their families were beat with batons, and more than forty peasants were killed in the skirmishes with militias. Thousands of people were detained under the doctrine of collective responsibility - sometimes most of a village's young men were arrested.\n\nDespite the claims of cruelty and police barbarism, the strike was eventually quelled, and the PSL leaders officially ended the struggle."
 poland.16.a: "Find and punish the agitators and those harbouring them."
 poland.16.b: "Better to get the peasants productive again."

 poland.17.t: "Berlin Demands Action"
 poland.17.d: "The rural unrest has also attracted the eye of German government. They have informed us of their intent to support our actions, no matter how harsh, to pacify the countryside, and they expect that the situation will be dealt swiftly. However the undertext of this otherwise polite telegram is obvious - the government in Berlin does not seem to trust us very much in handling this crisis effectively, and they wanted to remind us of that."
 poland.17.a: "With Berlin's backing, we can go all in."
 poland.17.b: "Has Berlin no better enemies than mob of peasants?"

 poland.18.t: "Protests Calm Down"
 poland.18.d: "The peasant strike has finally calmed down after decisive action from our government. The PSL has announced the end for the demonstrations - for now - and the peasant militias have dispersed back into the countryside.\n\nEven if the crisis was dealt with, it is still a formidable example of the organisational ability of the peasant movement. The strike was not the work of amateurs, but someone who could very well organise a revolution, should they gather more widespread support."
 poland.18.a: "Find and punish the agitators."
 poland.18.b: "Let's not agitate them any further."

 poland.19.t: "The Memory of the '37 Strikes"
 poland.19.d: "On the anniversary of the Great Peasant Strike of 1937, police were expecting minor unrest to break out, and had reserves dispatched to Lesser Poland voivodeships in advance. As expected, some peasant marches were arranged, and huge crowds gathered to the rural churches to pay respects to those who fell a year ago.\n\nThere were some calls to free the political prisoners still imprisoned because of their part in the strikes, but for the most part demonstrations remained peaceful this time."
 poland.19.a: "We need to be strict."
 poland.19.b: "Better not to escalate the situation this time."
 poland.19.c: "Free some political prisoners as a token of good will."

 poland.20.t: "Germany Refuses us Support"
 poland.20.d: "Berlin will not send us reinforcements. The message is clear: handle your own issues.\n\nWhile understandable, as Germany itself is still facing many internal issues, it does still make our position more difficult. More moderate voices in the King's council are advising on opening negotiations with the strikers, while more hardliners judge any kind of diplomacy as a \"weakness.\""
 poland.20.a: "Fine! We'll handle this ourselves."
 poland.20.b: "Let's negotiate with the strikers then."

 poland.21.t: "Support Arrives from Prussia"
 poland.21.d: "Multiple units of German reinforcements were dispatched to secure their government's interests in Lublin region today. Working in tandem with our reinforced law enforcement, we have successfully secured the main roads, and are able to start the large-scale suppression of the insurgency.\n\nThe attempts of organised resistance have been dealt with great efficiency, thanks to our superior communications and equipment."

 poland.22.d: "Our southern border has proved to be tiresome to manage, as the population on both sides are often sympathetic towards the Republican cause, and especially the gospel of peasant's liberation by the republicans.\n\nIt is not rare for us to find PSL activists bringing all kinds of contraband into our Kingdom over the border. Political pamphlets, books printed in Kraków, funds, and even known anti-monarchist agitators who have periodically escaped to Galicia. It is quite possible that the Danubian authorities are actively turning a blind eye on such actions, but we cannot prove anything."

We must do our best to convince them otherwise."
 poland.23.a: "Isn't one Poland enough for Vienna?"

 poland.24.t: "Anti-German Publications Spread"
 poland.24.d: "The royal authorities have generally kept the opposition newspapers under close watch. Many radical papers such as the socialist Oblicze Dnia and Robotnik have been banned multiple times due to their failure to comply with the censorship laws, and even more spurious publications remain unaccounted for. Lately even the less openly radical newspapers have started publishing texts questioning our alliance with the German Empire, and are calling for increased liberalisation.\n\nWe could take a harsher stance and quell even this critique - though it would carry the risk of pushing the republicans further towards radicalism."

Despite this, some members of the party have spoken harshly against some of the King's policies, such as the continued influence of General Guderian, and the perceived economic concessions to Berlin.\n\nWhile not actively anti-monarchist, these statements have sparked some alarm among the court, and high Privy Councillors have called for removal of these agitators from public office, on terms of acting against their own government."

It was revealed that he had been leaking highly confidential documents belonged to the royal administration to his mistress, who is suspected of being a Russian agent.\n\nThe nobleman himself has been detained and will stand trial for his actions against the Kingdom, but there is no knowing how much information he managed to share with his Russian succubus; the woman herself is nowhere to be found, and is suspected to have fled the country when his criminal dalliance was discovered."

 poland.27.d: "Yet again we came across pamphlets repeating Roman Dmowski's hateful words being shared in villages, slums, and even in churches. Much of it has been printed by the illegal Endecja newspaper, Gazeta Wolna Warszawska, but their network of underground prints has proven too elusive to crush entirely.\n\nDmowski, who directs his propaganda campaign from Moscow, has written another fire-and-brimstone essay calling for a national uprising, and throwing off the yoke of the Prussian tyrant. The most worrying part is that many seem to be interested in his promises of a truly Polish and Catholic nation, free of impurities and poverty."

 poland.28.d: "The police stumbled upon an alarming find: a cache of old Weltkrieg-era rifles, hidden in an obscure warehouse in the outskirts of Warsaw. We have some suspects who could be investigated for possession of these firearms - and possibly even for planning an armed revolution.\n\nThese are not the first hidden guns we have found during the past few years, as it is becoming increasingly clear that the socialist underground is smuggling and producing weapons for their doomed battle. As long as we stay one step ahead of them, and crush these seeds of revolution in the crib, the King should have nothing to worry about."

 poland.29.d: "Late last night we caught a French spy named Pierre Mardellat trying to cross the southern border. His purpose was, as we expected, building contacts with the Polish syndicalists. Mardellat took part in the Congress of the Polish Socialist Party a few days ago, no doubt carrying instructions from the Polish traitors in Paris to stack the party leadership with Communard sympathisers, instead of true law-abiding Poles.\n\nThis kind of direct contact with the Polish labour movement is extremely worrying, but as we have no proof of him actually influencing the PPS conference, there's little we can do legally besides punishing him from espionage."

It has proven to be an apt breeding ground for all kinds of socialists, syndicalists and communists, ready to listen to the false gospel of liberation preached by the PPS and the French.\n\nThere will always be some non-conformists, but we could limit the amount of radicalisation with some gestures of good will towards the workers, which could perhaps make the less radical ones listen to reason."

This is especially true in the countryside along the border, an area acting as a hotbed of peasant radicalism, with many people supporting the activists and their smuggling of political pamphlets and books to the north. Even the Polish municipal administrators and border guards have often turned a blind eye towards these activities, due to their own pro-unification sympathies.\n\nToday, Warsaw has asked us to better coordinate the border controls, in order to curb this criminal activity."

 poland.32.a: "Together we will stop these criminals."

 poland.33.t: "The Galicians will not cooperate"
 poland.33.d: "The Lwów government did not appear to be too interested or even aware of the border issue. They promised to do everything to stop the criminal activities, naturally, but it was very clear they do not intend to do much.\n\nPerhaps this should have been expected - Galicians no doubt actively support the radicals, wishing to destabilise our Kingdom for their own selfish gain."

 poland.35.d: "Poland's intelligence organisations have been closely intertwined with the German Abteilung both for budgetary reasons, and due to Germany's interest in keeping Warsaw under close watch. This cooperation has become increasingly insufficient, as the defunded German intelligence services have drastically cut their number of personnel assigned to Poland.\n\nDirector Tadeusz Pełczyński has lobbied hard for the foundation of a truly independent intelligence agency, and even the Germans in the Geheimrat do not seem to be entirely opposed to the idea. It would, however, be somewhat more expensive than our current arrangement."

 poland.42.t: "The Przytyk Pogrom"
 poland.42.d: "Surges of violence against Polish Jews are by no means rare, but the incident in the Jewish village of Przytyk, near Radom, has shocked the Kingdom. The disorder started from a minor dispute between a Jewish baker and a Polish farmer during the annual town fair. The relations between the Jews of Przytyk were already strained with the Polish Catholic farmers living around the town, and some local Poles were calling for boycotts against the Jews, who were blamed for undercutting Polish farmers' sales.\n\nThe fair turned into a riot, and the Jewish market stalls were attacked and their properties destroyed. The Jews, who had organised their own defence organisation, tried to defend themselves from the numerically superior host of Poles. Finally a Jewish member of the Zionist organisation Mizrachi, fired at the Poles. The shots turned the riot into a pogrom, as the crowd demanded blood. Many Jews were beaten, and some died of their injuries.\n\nAround fifty people were arrested in the aftermath of the riot, both Poles and Jews being accused of violence. Both present conflicting versions of the events, with both claiming to have acted in self-defence."

 poland.43.d: "The Przytyk Pogrom from two years ago is still fresh in the minds of many Jews, and yet there is already another significant outbreak of anti-Semitism among the Polish. Today, protests and riots engulfed the University of Warsaw, instigated by nationalist fraternities in the institution. While the demands of the students are vague and often contradictory, among those commonly repeated are the resignation of Jewish professors and university workers, such as linguistics professor Rafał Lemkin, who the students believe are peddling \"lies, syndicalist propaganda, and treasonous statements\".\n\nThe National Democrats' demand for limiting Jewish access to higher education has been brought to parliamentary debate once again. It is argued that Jews are over-represented in the Polish education system, as the protesting students are saying, and setting a \"numerus clausus\", a quotas for both Catholic and Jewish students, would in fact create a more equal society. This practice is not demanded by the law, but many universities already use their administrational autonomy to unofficially enforce it.\n\nDespite fierce protests by the left, and many intellectuals, it seems like the Numerus Clausus law is going to be passed in the Sejm. As a last resort, group of Jewish and Polish cultural influencers, many of them acquaintances of the royal family, have appealed to the king directly, in hopes that he will kill the legislation with his veto."

There have been multiple attacks against Jewish shops and the families who own them, especially in the northern regions where the National Democrats are the strongest. The pogrom in Wysokie Mazowieckie almost reached the scale of the events seen in Przytyk in 1936.\n\nSuch actions are augmented by calls to boycott Jewish shops and craftsmen by major right-wing newspapers, and the government's inaction towards the past cases have encouraged the radical right to be more open and more violent in their anti-Semitic actions."
 poland.45.a: "Nothing new under the sun."

#Kraków Conspiracy
 poland.46.t: "The Kraków Conspiracy"
 poland.46.d: "Secret activist organisations have plagued the Kingdom of Poland since its inception, as many of these conspiring groups had been already established during Russian rule. While the state police have been working tirelessly to capture the anti-monarchist radicals, we had no idea about the true scale of the problem. The series of events started to unfold when the Austrian Secret Police raided a small bank. The Unitary-Bank of Kraków was accused of money laundering for criminals, but the documents unearthed were massively more incriminating. The bank was used as a front for funding anti-monarchist activities in Kingdom of Poland - and the police even managed to capture their entire archive of transactions, full of sums and names. According to them, hundreds of thousands of marks have been run through the bank, disguised as business transactions. The money had come from not only other Galician banks, but Russian and Swiss institutions were also prominent. \n\nWhat is more shocking is the scale - almost the entire Polish political establishment is incriminated. Large \"donations\" had been covertly made to PPS- and PSL-aligned organisations and trade unions, chief among them the ZZZ. Russian money, especially, has gone to numerous senators and Sejm delegates from the ChZJN, and even the MKP. A large amount cannot be traced at all, but it seems clear that thousands of people and organisations in Poland have received funding to oppose the monarchy and propagate propaganda, including our coalition partners.\n\nThe issue is delicate and urgent, and the special National Committee of Safety (KON) has been founded to work under Minister Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski's leadership. An ardent anti-socialist and military man, Składkowski is expected to get to the bottom of Poland's rotting underground in no time."

 poland.47.d: "Polish security forces have always had close cooperation with their colleagues in Germany. The Abteilung, the military intelligence agency of Imperial Germany, has offered to help KON and the Polish police in our large-scale investigations after the dramatic revelations from the Kraków documents.\n\nWhile unpopular with the nationalists, the Abteilung's involvement would give us the resources needed to find all of the conspirators."

#Investigation to the church
 poland.48.t: "Investigation into the Church"
 poland.48.d: "The Catholic Church in Poland is perhaps the strongest institution after the state and the military, and is not to be meddled with without good reason. However, we have information detailing long and continuous contacts between Church officials - even men as highly-ranked as bishops - and the National Democrats' exiled leadership.\n\nIt is no surprise that many among the church support Roman Dmowski's thoughts, and would rather see the German King gone, but in general the Church has been willing to cooperate with the Kingdom in exchange for the royal patronage. The entire topic is divisive within the committee, with many members hoping to focus on the socialists instead."

 poland.49.d: "The secret police were able to uncover proof that numerous men in the Church administration have been funnelling funds to the Endecja's illegal publishing operations. The evidence also shows that Church organisations have helped to distribute anti-monarchist literature and leaflets.\n\nThis is worrisome, as interfering with the Church is walking on thin ice, as they have the hearts and minds of many Poles on their side. Moving against them can be risky, both for our popularity and the stability of our ruling coalition - but then again, if we do not act, the Church will continue harbouring the Dmowskites and other traitors."

#Investigation to the unions
 poland.53.t: "Investigating the Trade Unions"
 poland.53.d: "Polish urban workers have traditionally been well-organised and have a long history of resistance, together with the Polish Socialist Party. It is well known that the unions are a hotbed for socialists, but the government has been willing to tolerate them, so long as they eat away support from more treasonous syndicalists and anarchists, whose leadership has been forced either underground or in exile to France. \n\nTwo of the largest union organisations are the ZSZ and the ZZZ. The former has mostly sidelined the more radical elements from its leadership, but the ZZZ's leadership is full of revolutionaries, with their president Kazimierz Zakrzewski pulling the strings from Paris like a traitorous puppet-master. The government's strategy has thus far been a reluctant peace with ZSZ and the suppression of the ZZZ - but some think that we have been too lenient in our policy."
 poland.53.a: "Continue the lenient policy."
 poland.53.b: "We cannot allow the Communards to\ninfiltrate us."
 poland.53.tt: "We will attempt to root out the Syndicalist supporters from the Unions."
#Fate of the unions
 poland.54.t: "The Fate of the Trade Unions"
 poland.54.d: "Based on the results of our investigations, there is no doubt that many Polish trade unions have been in continuous contact with the exiled Zakrzewski and other French lapdogs in charge of the ZZZ. The details on actual French influence are somewhat unclear, but it gives us strong enough case to finally officially ban the ZZZ. There are even more radical voices in the Senate, calling for ban of all trade unions that consider themselves socialist.\n\nThe bans would give us a legal basis to arrest the union leadership and crack down on their conspiratorial activities, but there is fear that it might alienate more moderate socialists and turn them towards the syndicalists. But perhaps that is the cost we are willing to pay to excise this red tumour from our Kingdom?"
 poland.54.a: "Ban only the ones proven revolutionary."
 poland.54.b: "Ban all the socialist unions."
 poland.54.c: "Perhaps we should not."
#Strikes
 poland.55.t: "Strikes against the Government"
 poland.55.d: "Numerous trade unions have announced strikes as a form of resistance against government policies aimed to suppress them. The leaders of the ZSZ have called the actions of the government as tyrannical, and demand a compromise before they stand down. There are especially large strikes in Warsaw, Łódź and Kielce, with a large number of railway workers and metal industry workers refusing to clock-in, with their actions paralysing large parts of our heavy industry.\n\nStrike-breakers and Endek militias have been clashing with the strikers, but there is hesitancy over using too much force, as many of the unions involved are usually rather moderate, and have worked with the government in the past. Actions that are seen as too harsh might play directly into syndicalist rhetoric. Still, something needs to be done."
 poland.55.a: "We shall not compromise!"
 poland.55.b: "Negotiate with the unions."
 poland.55.c: "Send in the cavalry."
#Investigate bundists
 poland.56.t: "Investigating the Jewish Labour Bund"
 poland.56.d: "The General Jewish Labour Bund was formed in 1917 out of the ashes of the old Russian Empire, and they have kept no small amount of their past radicalism.\n\nOutwardly socialist and activist, the Bund is a very divisive party in Polish politics. The right has often branded them as revolutionary degenerates, but they are not clearly in the syndicalist camp either. They are also generally anti-Zionists, and seek cultural and social autonomy for the Jews in cooperation with other Polish liberal-leftist parties. However, there are many radicals within their ranks, and persecuting and arresting these Jewish revolutionaries would be a statement that would surely win us goodwill among the right."
 poland.56.a: "Well, you know what the National Democrats say about them..."
 poland.56.b: "The investigation should be fair and impartial."
#Bundist ties to the republicans
 poland.57.t: "Contacts between the Bundists and the PPS"
 poland.57.d: "There are a number of Bund-affiliated trade unions that are members of the ZZZ, but in general the Bund does not endorse syndicalism, and is closer to the more moderate line of Polish Socialist Party. Investigation into the funding and the contacts of the Bund leadership have not revealed anything dramatic - but it has confirmed just how deeply intertwined the Bund is within the Polish left, and how important of a base it is for socialist activists, from the social democrats to the hardline syndicalists.\n\nEven without the political dimension, persecuting a major Jewish organisation would carry serious consequences in ever-more polarised Polish politics, and whatever decision we make can give easy ammunition to the other side."
 poland.57.a: "Supporting the PPS is not illegal."
 poland.57.b: "They are one step away from syndicalism."
#Syndicalist support within the bund
 poland.58.t: "The Radical Wing of the Bund"
 poland.58.d: "The so called left wing of the General Jewish Labour Bund is composed of a group of syndicalist trade unions affiliated with the ZZZ, and following the lead of the exiled Kazimierz Zakrzewski. Backed by the French Secret Service, they have been trying to grow their influence within the Bund and possibly bring the party into the Third Internationale, and into open opposition to the Polish monarchy. They have been mediocre at best in their attempts thus far, but the grave economic situation has made ever more Jews sympathetic to their radical gospel.\n\nWe could take a heavy-handed approach and outlaw the ZZZ-aligned Jewish unions, or play the long game by favouring cooperation with the moderate wing of the Bund led by Victor Alter."
 poland.58.a: "These revolutionaries are a threat to Poland."
 poland.58.b: "Support the moderate wing."
#Surge of Anti-Semitic violence
 poland.59.t: "Surge in Anti-Semitic Violence"
 poland.59.d: "For having been the home of a large Jewish population since medieval times, Poland has had a poor track record in restraining anti-Semitic violence. Especially during times of crisis, like during the tumultuous years of 1917-1919, Jews were blamed for many issues such as famine and poverty. It has been the National Democrats' rallying cry since time immemorial: that the Jews are to blame for Poland's suffering, and that they are enemies to Polish and to Catholic culture. For the right, Jews are portrayed as a foreign element, a pro-German cancer festering in the heart of Poland, and for the left they are portrayed as the capitalists and the bourgeois, strangling the Polish peasants and workers with their unearned wealth. And many do believe these words. Incidents like the Raid on Myślenice, or seemingly random pogroms, are commonplace in Poland, and more often than not the police and the courts share this mindset.\n\nDuring the past few months, there has been another major wave of violence against the Jews, prompted by highly publicised accusations towards the Bund in major newspapers. Jewish businesses were attacked in Łódź, and a Jewish teacher was beaten to death in Radom, to mention only the most recent incidents. The police have been slow to react to these events."
 poland.59.a: "Nothing new under the sun."
 poland.59.b: "This is unacceptable!\nThe criminals must be tried!"
#radicalisation of the bund
 poland.60.t: "The Bund's Leftward Shift"
 poland.60.d: "In response to the recent wave of anti-Semitic violence, the more radically-minded wing of the Bund has won the presidency, and multiple important council positions under the leadership of syndicalist-minded Henryk Ehrlich, who has campaigned in the spirit of the French and the British revolutions.\n\nEven more moderate members of the Bund begrudgingly accept Ehrlich's more radical tone and his calls for direct action against the oppressive government."
 poland.60.a: "The polarisation continues."
#Investigtation of the officer corps
 poland.61.t: "The Investigation of the Officer Corps"
 poland.61.d: "Despite our best efforts, the Polish Officer Corps has stood as a citadel of Piłsudskite sympathies. This is perfectly understandable, as most of the men hold him in very high regard. Many of them fought and risked their lives with him, and had dedicated their entire youths to Piłsudski's vision of a free Poland. Some more fanatic Piłsudskites, such as Edward Rydz-Śmigły, were not allowed to return the army, but large majority of the older officers at least admired Piłsudski. A certain amount of respect towards Piłsudski is perfectly warranted, as long as it does not conflict with the army's primary duty: safeguarding the Kingdom of Poland.\n\nThe worrying part is that many officers still hold sympathies towards the republicans and other political factions who worked with Piłsudski. It has not caused any issues thus far, but more pro-German voices in the army have worried for the loyalties of the Piłsudskites should it come to war."
 poland.61.a: "Let's \"persuade\" Piłsudski's associates to retire."

#Mass protests
 poland.62.t: "Mass Protests against the Trial"
 poland.62.d: "People have taken to the streets in support of the accused officers, General Sosnkowski first and foremost. Peaceful demonstrations have been organised all across the nation, where people have waved Polish flags and arranged veterans of the Polish Legions to hold public speeches in favour of the accused patriots.\n\nThere has been uneasy calm among the army, but it is obvious that even they do not agree with the government's accusations. The entire debacle has been called \"opening up old wounds\" and \"Wilhelm's witch hunt\" in illegally distributed pamphlets that have been found among the protestors."
 poland.62.a: "Throw some medals at Sosnkowski to make it look more like an honour."
 poland.62.b: "The bickering of fools does not concern me."
#Activists Flock in Syndicalist Union
 poland.64.t: "Activists flock to Syndicalist Unions"
 poland.64.d: "It seems that our harsh policies towards the left have radicalised many of their members even further. Socialist propaganda against the monarchy has found more and more eager ears since our crackdowns against the moderate socialists. The membership for the ZZZ-aligned unions has grown dramatically during the past few months, at the expense of the more moderate unions.\n\nWe can attempt to remedy the situation either by tightening the screw even tighter, and punishing those involved for their insolence, or by trying to reverse the radicalisation by supporting the moderate unions."
 poland.64.a: "All unions are inherently treasonous vessels for pro-French agents!"
 poland.64.b: "Officially endorse non-socialist unions."

 poland.65.t: "Investigations into the Polish Socialist Party"
 poland.65.d.barlicki: "Polish socialists are no strangers to revolutionary action, and have often been the first ones to act against tyranny, real or perceived. It is no secret that the monarchy was a bitter pill to swallow for the PPS, which has been completely enamoured by Józef Piłsudski's overtly idealistic visions of a republican Poland, spanning from the Baltics to the Carpathian Mountains. Since then, the party has become a lukewarm supporter of the monarchy, but has not shed their radical wing - merely kept it out of the light.\n\nNormally the radicals of PPS-L have been allowed to act, as long as the main party has kept them in check, but KON's investigation has found proof that the radical infiltration runs much deeper in the party than was previously thought. However, our strategy of working with the moderate wing has borne fruit, as Norbert Barlicki has been successful in checking the far-left's power. Starting a political witch-hunt might backfire and radicalise the party even worse."

Not only is the radical wing conspiring against the monarchy, but the revolutionary mood has been spreading through the entire party, thanks to the new leadership, radical Stanisław Dubois chief among them. We can surely find proof of contacts with Paris, should we give his party a closer look."

 poland.67.t: "Investigations into the People's Party"
 poland.67.d: "The relationship between the People's Party and the monarchy has been stormy ever since its inception. The self-proclaimed enemy of the \"cliques of aristocratic lords\", the PSL has found the poor Polish countryside as fertile land to sow anti-monarchist and anti-German sentiment. They have lukewarmly cooperated with the monarchy now and again, but ultimately they remain opposed to the very principles of monarchy and the rule of the elite.\n\nUsefully for us, they have long enjoyed support from their Galician brothers, and by extension, a foreign power. It would not be difficult to acquire proof of any dealings with the Austrians - and with such proof, we could imprison large parts of their grassroots organisation. However, a mere threat of action might be enough to let the peasants \"sort\" through their own ranks, and get rid of the worst agitators and troublemakers for us."

 poland.70.t: "The Endecja Infiltration"
 poland.70.d: "Although with one hand the Polish right offers us help, the other holds a dagger. For a long time, the royal government has left the Chadecja and their allies in relative peace, as they have been trusted allies in the Circle's policies, supporting both the military expansion and safeguarding the rights of the major landowners. The Chadecja hold enormous sway in the Kingdom's conservative institutions such as the senate, the Church, the judiciary and the army, and have expanded their influence deeper and deeper during the past years, feeding on both anti-socialist and anti-monarchist sentiment. \n\nEven in exile, Roman Dmowski's word still carries great influence in Poland, especially inside our coalition. Many prominent right-wing politicians that are supporters of the monarchy had been members of the Endecja in their youth, and certainly see Dmowski as their ideological father. This raises a question of divided loyalties, one which we have for long ignored for the sake of parliamentary cooperation with the Chadecja and other conservative parties in the ChZJN.\n\nThis has changed after the revelations that a number of prominent right-wing politicians have kept contacts with their former colleagues in Russia through the Galician National Democrats, who are allowed to operate in relative freedom. Through this pipeline, Roman Dmowski has spewed his pro-Russian propaganda, and directed funds from Moscow to the pockets of Polish senators and noblemen. We have the names - but the question is, do we dare to act?"

 poland.72.t: "The Far-Right Organisations"
 poland.72.d: "One of the most alarming developments of the past few years have been the rise of far-right paramilitary groups, chief among them the ONR, the National Radical Camp, which has risen to national prominence thanks to their violent acts towards Jews, and anyone else perceived as the enemies of Christianity. Even worse, ONR's stand against the rule of law \"in the name of Poland and God\" has emboldened many older far-right movements, such as the radically anti-socialist Order of the Knights of Law and the Straż Narodowa, a banned Endecja-aligned paramilitary organisation.\n\nWhat is new, however, is that finally we have proof that they have received huge sums of money from wealthy Poles, especially from those in Poznań. By acting on this information, we could hit their funding hard, and drive their quasi-legal front organisations underground. Such actions would be especially supported by more liberal members of the investigations committee - though some do think that ONR serves the Kingdom better as a tool against the socialists."

This would effectively freeze the Sejm until the elections - but for some, it is the preferred alternative to giving into ChZJN's demands."

There are cases of serious and minor corruption, smuggling, bypassing censorship, being involved with illegal political organisations, supporting terrorism and anti-monarchist activities, as well as conspiracy and treason.\n\nWe have earned the ire of many with our \"witch hunts\", but law enforcement officials assure us that it has been for good reason: dozens of different nonconformist organisations have been practically destroyed by the arrests, and the rest of the troublesome opposition has been driven underground or abroad. With one broad stroke, hundreds of the King's enemies have been swept away."
 poland.81.d2: "The largest criminal investigations in Polish history have ended with numerous convictions. Dozens of cases of egregious corruption, revealed by the Kraków Papers, have been handled severely. Deeper investigations found many more that are guilty of crimes - even some as bold as conspiracy against the throne. The thorough investigations revealed just how well-connected our political opposition is to foreign nations, especially along the Galician border.\n\nOur arrests should reduce their ability to cause us further harm, though many slipped through the fingers of our police, as we did not wish to gather ill-publicity by chasing more dubious cases."
 poland.81.d3: "The largest criminal investigations in Polish history have ended with little in terms of actual convictions. Some of the most egregious cases of corruption revealed by the Kraków Papers were handled quickly, but deeper investigations were found wanting.\n\nDue to the lack of solid evidence, only relatively few arrests were made. It is hoped that through mercy to the scandal, the opposition will deflate and the social polarisation of our nation may taper off."

 poland.88.d: "The Kingdom of Poland has been as stable as it is, largely because of the support from the political centre and moderate liberals. Their promise has always been constitutionalism and adherence to democracy, even if it is guided by the King - which has kept Poland relatively democratic. Unfortunately, that has also enabled the political opposition to organise in the open, to grow in strength and to radicalise.\n\nSome among the right wing of the Circle believe that our past support for democracy was a mistake, and that Poland is doomed to fall into revolutionary fanaticism, should the opposition continue their anti-monarchist agitation on both the left and right of the political spectrum.\n\nNormally, members of the Sejm have legal immunity during their tenure, but there are a number of ways to circumvent this constitutional check, and enable the National Committee of Safety to persecute the leadership of disloyal parties."

 poland.89.d: "With King August IV's order, today the Sejm was dissolved. All the members of the lower house were required to resign, while the Senate was prorogued for an undefined amount of time, presumably until the next election. This leaves the governance of the state in the hands of the King, and a temporary caretaker government. In practice, this will freeze any legislation from passing in the Sejm, but it will also remove the legal immunity of the Sejm delegates.\n\nThis move has been met with furious opposition, but little can be done now to reverse it, save for protests. Needless to say, the use of such extreme measures has made it clear to many that the King is not interested in parliamentarism, and is first and foremost looking out for German interests above those of Poland. Still, there are some voices who spoke in favour of him, citing the dissolution as a sad but necessary tool to save Poland from a syndicalist takeover."

As one of the richest landowners in Poland, Zamoyski is a well-known figure in Polish politics and already a member of the Geheimrat. He has been a loud spokesman for the Polish aristocracy and for cooperation with the National Democrats - and as of late, Zamoyski has made considerable attempts to sway the King's favour.\n\nZamoyski's colourful stories of the adventures and duels of his youth have given him a reputation of an adventurer in the court. His openly nationalistic tone and shared past with Roman Dmowski has made for him many enemies among the King's advisors, who would rather see him fail, but August IV himself is impressed by Zamoyski's charisma."

Zamoyski, naturally, denies everything, and has considerable popular support.\n\nIt would be relatively easy to simply claim the letters as falsifications, and to avoid the backlash of persecuting the richest man in Poland... but if the accusations are true, he might be a dangerous enemy for the King indeed."

Downarowicz is a loud opponent of the reactionary policies of the Kingdom, and has always been a voice of moderation and even cooperation with the Centrolew.

The French support for independent Poland is an idea that goes far back to Napoleonic times, and the current Germanic domination over Poland has made the idea shine even brighter. There is a significant Polish minority in northern France, grown out of many emigrations of Poles away from the Prussian or the Tsarist jackboot. They have organised themselves into the Revolutionary Committee of Poland, in Lille, currently headed by Sorelian-minded Kazimierz Zakrzewski, the exiled chairman of the Polish Union of Trade Unions (ZZZ).\n\nThe syndicalists in Poland are either acting from the underground - something they are quite accustomed to by now - or through the left wing of the PPS, the Polish Socialist Party, whose internal struggles are closely followed in France. However, the Revolutionary Committee has little faith in victory through parliamentary means, and is focusing on preparation for the revolution, first and foremost.

If Dubois and his faction win, it might lead to the radicalisation of the PPS, the splintering of the Centrolew bloc, and the collapse of our efforts in Poland.\n\nSome of the less optimistic people in our foreign office do not like the idea of meddling in Poland even further, and point out that Dubois is unlikely to win in the first place.

After hours of debate and arguments for both sides, Norbert Barlicki's supporters ultimately won the day.\n\nThe result prompted outrage among the more radical members of the congress, but it seems this outcome gives the royal government a chance to breathe.\n\nBarlicki is not a fire-and-brimstone socialist like Dubois, but he has been open towards cooperation with the monarchy in the past. However, he is known to harbour contacts to the Austrian side of Poland - but then again, so is most of the Centrolew, so that is hardly news."

Ultimately, supporters of Stanisław Dubois won the day.\n\nThe outcome prompted outrage among the more moderate members of the party, and many fear that Dubois' bold rhetoric will irritate the royal authorities even further. Dubois has vowed to renew the party's vigour and take a more uncompromising stance towards the monarchy, which he sees as wholly undemocratic in nature.

This project is born out of cooperation with the Austrian Poles, who desire unification with free Poland, and the imperial hawks, who see Poland part of Austria's natural sphere of influence. Despite German attempts to keep Poland firmly in their pocket, we have garnered a lot of influence in the Kingdom - friendship organisations, industrialists, even ministers and councillors.\n\nThe main vessel of our influence is the Centrolew bloc, the democratic opposition to the King's government. We have been supporting the Centrolew for a decade now, primarily through their contacts with the Galician side of Poland. The hope is that if the Centrolew can secure a major electoral victory, they will move Poland dramatically away from the German sphere and into ours - which would naturally benefit both of us more than the current situation."

Originally this well-known Polish statesman headed the Polish National Committee for the Entente, but after the French and the British revolutions, fate brought him to Moscow, the only Entente government still standing and continuing the fight against the German oppressors.\n\nAn alliance was made: the Russians would support his underground fight against the German monarchy in Poland, and in exchange his Poland would be an ally to Russia. His name and party, the National Democrats, commands enormous respect among the Polish right, one we can utilise to destabilise King August's monarchy to our own gain."

MKP-aligned parties secured [?POL_royal_influence]% of the seats in the Sejm, while their allies in the CZJN won the share of [?POL_nat_influence]%.\n\nWith the control of the Senate secure, this great election result makes sure that Ponikowski's government can continue their path of moderation, and keeping Poland on the right path."

Despite the unrest and major economic depression, the MKP managed to guide the nation through it and keep the support of the people.\n\nThe King has voiced his support of the new government, and most of the upper class seems satisfied for the victory of the status quo. The Centrolew Alliance, debating on what they did wrong, has shown its weakness against the less radical idea of Poland."
 poland.151.d.ch: "The new President of Ministers, young and charismatic Józef Chaciński, has sworn in to lead His Majesty's cabinet. With a slim majority in both the Sejm and the Senate, Chaciński's largely Christian Democratic government will be able to continue with their policies that do not dramatically differ from the ones of the previous government.\n\nIt is however expected that Chaciński will seek to distance the Kingdom from German influence, and enact more nationalistic-minded policies such as legislation against Jewish business owners. It remains to be seen if the cabinet will keep the King's trust in the future."

The Centrolew now faces massive challenges - to deliver to the people what they have promised, against a deeply conservative Senate and the King who views the left with suspicion, especially after the rise of radicalism in the aftermath of Black Monday.\n\nMany political analysts give the new government one year, maximum; after all, there has never been a Centrolew government in Poland that has lasted through an entire term."

There have been not large scale protests, nor accusations of electoral fraud.\n\nPerhaps it is because of the heightened security and the war weariness, but it is also true that life is, in many ways, better than it was in 1938. Unemployment is low, the streets are safe and Polish democracy has survived relatively unscathed. This all paves a way for the continuation of the status quo."
 poland.153.d.auth: "The elections of 1942 have gone much more smoothly than the chaotic events of 1938. The rabid paramilitaries are all but gone, and the opposition is driven underground.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the Kingdom of Poland knows stability and security under strong leadership instead of the bickering politicians. A great many opposition delegates decided not to run at all, having lost the support of the people. Those who ran were investigated thoroughly, to make any radical opinions known.

 poland.154.d.centrolew: "[POL.GetSecondInCommand]'s government has done much to build a safe and secure foundation for the republic, but much of their initial popularity has waned. A disappointing amount of Polish political life has returned to mundane politicking, and debates over small if practical details, as opposed to the great idealism that gave birth to the republic. An essentially three-party system has been created in Poland, with the PPS, PSL and ChZJN. Both parties in government have blamed the other for trying to sideline their allies and only favour their own electorate.\n\nThe People's Party is very much in a kingmaker position, especially as many of their more conservative agrarian members, who joined the party after dissolution of the MKP, have been eyeing a coalition with those further to the right, to avoid further concessions to the left. The socialists are aware of this, and are already expecting treason from their peasant allies. Their virulent election campaign has branded any attempts to work with the ChZJN as concessions to the \"monarchists\", who would rather drag Poland back to Germany's arms."
 poland.154.d.soccon: "After the monarchist centre was wiped out and the left failed to secure their rule, the National Union found itself as the strongest parliamentary faction. Many former members of the Circle rallied to the Chadecja and the right-aligned parties, seeing them as the best alternative to the monarchy.\n\nWith their support and a strong pre-existing power base, the rightist ChZJN-Endecja coalition has secured control of the Sejm for now, despite a fiery opposition campaign."

Many saw a moderate such as Leopold Skulski as a fitting successor for Ponikowski, but to the surprise of the old guard of the Circle politicians, the party's black sheep won the MKP's internal vote for leadership - and thus becomes the new prime minister.\n\nFormer PSL activist, Aleksy Ćwiakowski, has become the face of the young guard of Polish monarchists. Unlike the old independence men who formed the MKP, Ćwiakowski would rather cooperate with the peasant liberals of PSL instead of the more traditional Christian Democrat allies who have sustained Ponikowski's governments. As proof of concept, Ćwiakowski managed to win a record vote in the traditional PSL and PPS strongholds, through his support towards farmer's associations and strong grassroots presence. In his mind, the MKP cannot remain a movement of the middle class, but the monarchy must win over the Polish peasant if it is to thrive. While he is more radical than his predecessor, he is generally liked both inside and outside the party as a man with fresh ideas and boldness to try them."

But even with this strong mandate from the people, the Prussian tyrant on the throne has dared to openly move against us. We had counted on the King's tolerance towards liberalism and usual inaction in day-to-day politics, but it seems that his reactionary puppet-masters in the Privy Council have persuaded August IV to stand against us.\n\nWith his hated veto power, the King has single-handedly crushed the legislation that was accepted with an overwhelming majority in the Sejm. With this wildly antidemocratic move, it has become clear that [POL.GetSecondInCommand] no longer enjoys the trust of His Majesty and should resign.

While such emergency laws are not rare during wartime, many see the act as yet another way for the anti-democratic forces in Poland to suppress their opposition.\n\nWith the emergency powers, the government and the monarch can pass decrees of a temporary nature with minimal parliamentary oversight. In practice, this means that the Sejm will have no saying over the conduct of the war, and that [POL.GetSecondInCommand] - or more probably, a military man the King names - is a dictator in all but name - temporarily, naturally."

The Old Centre of Warsaw was filled with flags with clovers and roses, as a symbol of the brotherhood between the peasants and the workers, the core of the movement. The mounted police were uneasily following the flood of people as they gathered around the Royal Palace and various other government buildings, shouting slogans against the King and his corrupt government. In the fashion of the Revolution of 1905, a general strike was announced to begin the very next day.\n\nKing August IV did not make an appearance to the protesters, as his councillors pleaded for caution. Surrounded in the palace and in the numerous garrisons, the Germans in power realised for the first time just how few they were in number.

The entire nation has come to a standstill. The general strike has frozen the cities, and the peasants are arranging marches all around the nation. Some are using the unrest as pretext for looting and destroying Jewish properties, but for the most part, the protesters have been peaceful - which makes our position even more difficult. Should we fight against them, the any popular support would be beyond recovery.\n\nVarious plans have been drafted by the cabinet and the military, but no one is very hopeful. The Privy Council is urging the King to leave the Palace, which has been surrounded by protesters for days. Some are calling for the use of military force, but August has been hesitant to take such harsh measures. Due to the King's inaction, General von Kries has put a plan in motion and called for Guderian's armoured regiment to secure the capital with reinforcements from Dobrzanski's division. Their troops should be loyal to the King and can be trusted... but such a small force could easily be overwhelmed in Warsaw's narrow streets. General Berbecki, one of our most trusted Polish generals, has suggested to the King that he declare a state of emergency, and to mobilise as many troops as is needed to keep the peace."

It is clear that a large part of the army has turned against us, making the situation ever more precarious.\n\nThe King is now stuck in the middle of an uprising with constantly emboldening demands: the resignation of the government, the abdication of the King, the cessation of German military presence, an endless list of social and political reforms.

The confusion quickly turned into fear, as the military police and German reinforcements were deployed in great numbers to clear the main part of the city of protesters. Many were turned away at the barrel of a gun or a bayonet. At first it looked like it could work out - both the protesters and the soldiers were told to avoid violence as much as possible, but when the units of the Black Division arrived to free the Palace, the crowd - led by ex-Legionary Stanisław Dubois, radical socialist and agitator - refused to budge.\n\nWhen the protesters started stoning the soldiers approaching with bayonets, Guderian finally ordered the use of live ammunition. Despite protests from his Polish colleagues, the rifles sang. Men and women fell to the street... but instead of routing, they stood their ground, and their previous pacifistic action turned into a chaotic melee.\n\nThe German reinforcements the royalists had received did not hesitate to act.

 poland.203.d1: "The manifesto was clear: from now on, Poland would be a republic, led solely by the Polish people and not a foreign autocrat. In the end, that was the one demand that mattered. The King's advisors were furious, as was to be expected. August was advised to ask his father for help, and was told to stall and strike a compromise. But in an atypical moment of decisiveness, August Wilhelm denied them all. \"I do not wish to rule over the people who prefer to see me gone\", he earnestly explained. Perhaps it was simply a surrender to his fate, complete hopelessness or a surprising moment of moral fibre, but King August IV gave up the throne.\n\nAs the nation silenced to listen to the King's historical radio address, thousands of people rejoiced. They had won, and it had not required countless deaths. The final shouts of \"Long live the King\" were heard across Warsaw as the King signed his abdication. Left without purpose, his cabinet followed suit soon after. The Clover Revolution has succeeded - but could the Centrolew keep their dream?"

The King's advisors were furious, as was to be expected. August was advised to ask his father for help, and was told to stall and strike a compromise. He was told to regroup and take the rest of the nation with the force of Polish sabre and German steel. But in an atypical moment of decisiveness, August Wilhelm denied them all. \"I do not wish to rule over the people who prefer to see me gone\", he regretfully explained as the streets of Warsaw were still red from innocent blood. And despite all the pleas for him to stay, August stood uncharacteristically defiant. He would not have more bloodshed; he would rather abdicate than wage war against his adopted people.\n\nSo, to the shock of both his allies and enemies, the King held a historical radio address, announcing his abdication and calling for the resignation of his government. Thousands of people rejoiced. All of the nation celebrated - except for Warsaw, where a wary garrison watches the streets as the King's cabinet tries to get sense of the situation." #TODO

 poland.204.d: "A special session of the Sejm was called as soon as possible. The nation was returning to normality, or at least as much as it could. So was the parliament, with one notable exception - most delegates from the Circle were absent, either because of boycott or because of fear. They were not missed, either, as their absence made the Centrolew the undisputed ruler of the Sejm. [POL.GetLeader] was to be elected as the provisional President, until a proper election could be arranged.\n\nThe more thorny question was that of the constitution. Even though the Sejm had elected to abolish the monarchy with an overwhelming majority, ChZJN and other conservative parties still held a good third of the seats, and in the Senate the Centrolew's majority was even thinner. The planned constitution, modelled after the People's Republic of Belarus, faced fierce resistance from the right, and could not be passed as it required at least a two-thirds majority as per the current constitution.\n\nAfter lengthy debates, many parts of it were defanged. Neither abolition of the Senate nor official secularisation could be turned into law. Though despite some bitter compromises, many of the Centrolew's ideas came to pass. The new People's Republic would abolish censorship, and guarantee equal rights to everyone. Democratic elections for the Sejm would be held every three years, and it would hold the supreme power. The Senate would act only as an advisory body, that could send laws back to the Sejm but not ban them entirely. The President would be elected by the Sejm for the term of five years, but his powers would be greatly reduced from the executive tyranny of the kingdom. The liberal coalition had hopes to eventually enact their more radical policies, but it does not seem to be possible with the current Sejm. Instead, a government must be formed to steer the republic... and maybe eventually solidify the free and equal Poland for the first time after the Partitions. The prime minister will be..."

Despite his popularity, he is right: a proper vote is needed to ascertain the president's popularity and suitability for the whole country, not just the ruling government. However, thanks to a quite strong majority of the PPS and PSL in the Sejm, there is less need to compromise with the right, though they will certainly block some of the most radical candidates.\n\nBarlicki is an obvious man for the job, but some would rather elect an older, more traditional and bipartisan politician such as Wojciechowski, having secured respect of wider Polish society and not just the left.\n\nAs the dark horse of the election, Jan Woźnicki has been put forward as charismatic compromise candidate, as his former membership of the National Democrats could win some goodwill from the right."

 poland.219.d: "Catastrophe has struck the House of Hohenzollern - a revolution in Poland has overthrown King August IV and declared a republic, led by peasants. Many see the revolution as a massive blow to German prestige, and will no doubt increase unrest in the East - and make us look weak in front of the Russians. An even further humiliation, the newborn Polish republic is Austrian-backed, and may soon join their sphere.\n\nThe hawks in our government are calling for bold moves - the restoration of the monarchy through force of arms, even. More pragmatic statesmen do admit that it would be a wasted effort to prop up another unpopular monarchy in Poland - but their new government could be coerced to accept all the same treaties as the Kingdom had. Perhaps it would also be seen as lenience towards the Poles, winning us some hard-needed support there."

German demands are simple: the republic will consider itself bound to all treaties of the Kingdom, including Mitteleuropa and Reichspakt membership. All privileges enjoyed by Germans in Poland shall continue to be enforced, though the Geheimrat can be dissolved due to its irrelevance to the republican form of government.\n\nAll in all, the deal is relatively good - though there are many among our supporters who would see renewal of these agreements as giving up the fruits of the revolution.

The new Republic of Poland shall keep many of their obligations to Germany and the other nations of the Reichspakt, including free passage of troops.\n\nHowever, it still marks a decisive break from German control of Polish affairs, and a major increase of Vienna's importance in the European theatre.

There is, however, a loud minority, particularly in the PPS, who have denounced the treaty as treason and the selling out the revolutionary ideals of an independent People's Poland.

In the east, Ukrainian and Belarussian forces have advanced to the suburbs of Lublin. The German Foreign Minister has explained that the lawful, royalist government of Poland has asked irs allies in the Reichspakt to support Polish law enforcement in suppressing the French-sponsored syndicalist uprising that has seized control of much of the nation.\n\nOn the ground, the situation is quite different, and everyone knows it. There have been multiple firefights between Reichspakt forces and Polish units, and the bloodshed is expected to get worse as the Germans close in on Warsaw. Many soldiers have joined the revolutionary government, and improvised Red Guards have sprung in Warsaw and Łódź to defend the revolution. There is much left to be desired, however, as a majority of the Polish army is confined to their barracks, away from the cities, thanks to the officer corps who are deeply distrustful of the \"socialist power grab\" in the capital.\n\nThe revolution was smashed to pieces in mere days. Bitter fighting in the suburbs of Warsaw had not yet been quelled, when King August IV announced that the revolutionaries had been suppressed, and that law and order have once again returned to the nation.

Ever since German Imperialism denied us our chance in 1916, many have abandoned all hopes of such a project. The political tide has turned since then, and it seems that such a union is once again on the table. Warsaw made the official request of starting such negotiations, with German approval.\n\nSimply put, the proposal would mean ceding Western Galicia and parts of Eastern Galicia, yet to be determined, to Poland in exchange for greatly beneficial economic treaties. This solution is both supported by the Poles of our empire and the Emperor himself. According to the supporters of the Austro-Polish Solution, the Galician Poles have not become Austrians in 150 years, and they will not ever become ones - so it would make sense to give them their own state in the Austrian sphere of influence.

Enraged by the \"communist\" policies against the Church by the Centrolew government, many soldiers secretly pledged their support to Rydz's plot. There had been worries about the Endecja infiltration of the armed forces, but the conspiracy had ran too deep to be entirely cut out, and on the morning it was already too late.\n\nThe disloyal forces moved to secure the bridges of Warsaw under the leadership of Rydz's co-conspirator Wacław Stachiewicz, while the ringleader himself marched to the city centre to meet with the President."

Fighting broke out after the first refusal, as Rydz's men moved to disarm the remaining loyalists from the Warsaw garrison. The fighting was fierce, but in the end Warsaw fell entirely to the coup. Faced with only two choices: civil war or resignation, both the President and the cabinet chose the former option. The government with such high hopes of democracy and liberty had fallen.\n\nThe victorious Edward Rydz-Śmigły took up the position of Chief of Army and the Minister of Defence, while the rest of the cabinet were formed by the National Democrats, and associates of Rydz."

Fighting broke out after the first refusal, as Rydz's men moved to disarm the remaining loyalists from the Warsaw garrison. The fighting was fierce, and the men still loyal to government were tightly barricaded to their garrisons, causing great trouble to the rebels to dislodge them.\n\nThe fighting in the city held up so many of Rydz's forces, that he could not defend against General Kazimierz Sosnkowski's 1st Cavalry Regiment's incursion from the north. In mere hours, the coup fell into pieces, as Sosnkowski's forces shattered the defenders and caused the rest to surrender, as they realised their failure.

In addition to the city, there is the rest of Eastern Galicia to consider - which is mostly Ukrainian and Romanian.\n\nWe could give it to Poland for their guarantees of high regional autonomy, cede it to Ukraine as is the popular will, or simply keep it under the Habsburg Crown."

 poland.248.d1: "After lengthy negotiations, we have failed to secure ourselves the city of Lviv, but the Austrians had the sense to cede at least the Stanislaviv region to the [UKR.GetNameDef].\n\nAs a disappointing consolidation prize, the Poles have promised to grant regional autonomy to the Ukrainians inside their borders, but it is hard to believe that they will uphold their promises, no matter how liberal their government is."
 poland.248.d2: "After lengthy negotiations, we have finally triumphed over the Poles and persuaded the Austrians to see the reason: Lviv is rightfully a Ukrainian city, and it should remain so.\n\nA national celebration was declared, as the union of Eastern Galicia and Ukraine was proclaimed - one that will never be severed again.

 poland.249.d: "It seems that the Austrians have betrayed us yet once. The perfidious Habsburgs have conspired with the Ukrainians to steal the city of Lwów from us, despite the clear majority of the population being Poles. The fact that prominent Galician Ukrainian organisations pleaded Vienna for this outcome is of no consequence. Ukrainian propaganda about the \"threat of Polonisation\" seems to have been effective at turning the peasants against us.\n\nThis incident has led to disappointment, especially due to our seemingly close relations with Austria, and even sparked some protests against Vienna."

 poland.251.t: "The Act of Recovery of [GetYear]"
 poland.251.d1: "Chełm was annexed into the Kingdom in 1919, and it has remained as the only part of Poland with a significant Orthodox population. Much of this was carried out forcibly in the 19th century, when the Tsarist authorities sought to colonise this part of ancient Polish territory with Russian and Ukrainian settlers. There has already been some progress in reclaiming the national character of the Chełm voivodeship, but the work can start in earnest, after passing of the Act of Recovery.\n\nThis executive order defines a plan to integrate the region properly into Poland, through settling Polish veterans and returning Ruhr Poles to the voivodeship, and by closing Orthodox Churches that are found to have cooperated with Russia and other traitorous elements. Conversion to the Roman Catholic faith will be rewarded greatly. "
 poland.251.d2: "Unification with Galicia-Lodomeria has brought us millions of new Ukrainian citizens. The earlier government in their foolishness had agreed to grant these Ukrainian voivodeships wide cultural autonomy, including their own local administration and courts. It is exactly this kind of disunity that has made Poland weak in the past. A plan has been drafted to remove these autonomies and properly integrate the Ruthenian Voivodeships into Poland proper.\n\nThe Act of Recovery authorises settlements of Polish veterans and the Ruhr Poles to the region, and widespread assault of the Orthodox Church's power will be started. After all, it was Orthodox Church that did all in their power to support the Russian oppressors who wished the destruction of Poland - how could we trust them after that? Conversions into Roman Catholicism will be greatly rewarded and encouraged. "
 poland.251.a: "Poland will be whole again!"

 poland.252.t: "The March against Polonisation"
 poland.252.d: "The current government of [POL.GetSecondInCommand] has restarted the divisive Polonisation programmes endorsed by the National Democrats. These programmes are in practice legislation that officially discriminates against the Jews and Ukrainians of the Chełm region, and the other minorities in our border regions. Even though many Poles are silently accepting towards anti-Semitic policies, this Polonisation has become a symbol of the perceived backwardedness and reactionary nature of [POL.GetSecondInCommand]'s government.\n\nThe opposition, spearheaded by Jewish organisations such as the Labour Bund, have organised major demonstrations against the government, especially in the southern regions, where the strongholds of the Peasant's Party have openly backed the Jews in a united struggle against the government."
 poland.252.a: "Perhaps some compromises are necessary..."
 poland.252.b: "Fix bayonets!"

 poland.253.t: "The Birth the of Ukrainian Military Organisation"
 poland.253.d: "The Recovery Action of Eastern Małopolska has yielded some results, but the Ukrainian resistance has proved to be greater than anticipated. It seems that their opposition is coordinated and supported by the so-called \"Ukrainian Military Organisation\", from the Ukrainian side of the border. Their funding and agitation has radicalised the peasantry, serving as yet another proof for the need of an ethnically united Poland.\n\nLuckily, we have inherited effective secret police from the days of King August, and can bear the entire weight of it against the terrorists promoting hatred and death in our southern voivodeships."
 poland.253.a: "See that the police have all the resources\nthey need."

 poland.254.t: "The Spectre of Piłsudski"
 poland.254.d: "The secret police has uncovered disturbing indications that there is a conspiracy spreading inside the military, focused around Edward Rydz-Śmigły's tight-knit group of former Legionaries. It seems that they stayed in contact with each other even after the Polish Military Organisation, the POW, ceased their activities in 1921 after resistance to German rule became futile. Rydz-Śmigły was their leader, having risen to the position after Józef Piłsudski's imprisonment in 1917. We have yet to identify other conspirators or their goals, but it seems probable that men like Adam Koc and Kazimierz Sosnkowski - former comrades of Piłsudski and members of the POW - are involved.\n\nThe important question, however, is what should be done about this clandestine clique inside the Polish military. We could merely promote men loyal to us over them, and break up the Rydz-Śmigły clique all across the country in less important commands... or we could start clandestine talks between the government officials and Rydz-Śmigły's men. The war is coming, and a moment to rise up against the Germans might yet come in near future - and in this fight we would have very similar goals with the conspirators."

 poland.255.d.monarchy: "A deal with Edward Rydz-Śmigły's group has been reached. When the time is right and German armies are preoccupied, the military will march to Warsaw and arrest the King and his council, and any generals who side against their lawful government. At the same time, operations would be launched to secure control of other major cities, radio stations and the border garrisons.\n\nIt is unlikely that there would be much resistance, as even the republican-minded parties would support us. The greatest threat will be the merciless German response. In a more controversial part of the agreement, Rydz-Śmigły will be named the Chief of State in place of the king, to lead the temporary Council of State, until there is no more need for him and elections will be arranged.\n\nThe conspirators raised their glasses for the upcoming final liberation of Poland, for this time it would last."
 poland.255.d.republic: "A plan by Edward Rydz-Śmigły's associates has been accepted by the most important ministers, a close inner ring which has been in power since Rydz's coup. This \"Operation Parasol\" is essentially a daring plan to stab Germany and Austria in the back, should an opportunity show itself. The military would march to Warsaw, Edward Rydz-Śmigły would be appointed as the Chief of State, and disloyal generals and politicians would be arrested in what is essentially a self-coup. At the same time, operations would be launched to secure control of other major cities, radio stations and the border garrisons.\n\nIt is unlikely that there would be much resistance, as even the socialist-minded parties would support us rather than the Germans. The greatest threat will be the merciless German response. If Germany declares war, executive power shall be given to the Council of State formed out of the military men, until there is no more need for them, and elections will be arranged.\n\nThe conspirators raised their glasses for the upcoming final liberation of Poland, for this time it would last."
 poland.255.a: "Na Zdrowie!"

 poland.256.t: "The Restoration of Elections"
 poland.256.d: "Poland has been freed, under the guidance of the First Marshal. As the threat of war is gone and reconstruction can start, leaders of many parties have started to call for disbanding the Council of State, and creating a genuinely republican form of government. Naturally, Chief of State Rydz-Śmigły has assured that elections will be organised, and the following months saw a surge of political activity. However, strict wartime censorship was still in place, and the Marshal's own party, the OZN, was given a dispropotionate amount of media coverage and funding. Alleged electoral corruption sparked some public protests, but Rydz-Śmigły's personal popularity was too great for real mass action to start against him.\n\nAs Poland still officially has the constitution of the monarchy in place, Rydz-Śmigły wields most powers of the monarch, including appointing the cabinet. An inclusive broad front government led by Bogusław Miedziński including ministers from other parties would please most of the minor parties, and would strengthen the regime's propaganda of truly representing all Poles from left to the right, just like Józef Piłsudski had done. However, a smaller cabinet led by Adam Koc composed of \"apolitical\" military men might be a more efficient solution. Naturally Rydz himself will be elected as the president, and will keep his position as the Chief of Army, ensuring continuing security and prosperity of the Polish people."

 poland.257.d: "The first act of the new Sejm is to start drafting a constitution, one that would officially change the monarchy-era constitution into something not imposed by foreign tyrants, but rather crafted by the whole nation of Poland. The old constitution had sought to maintain the position of the old elites from the Partition era, but the new one is based around the idea of the common good of all the citizens. However, the citizens are also expected to act in the common good of the nation, and their rights could be limited if they chose not to do so.\n\nThe president is to be the ultimate guarantor of the nation's security, serving for terms of seven years, and having rights essentially identical to that of August IV some years ago. The president is appoint ministers and military staff, and coan veto legislation at will. The president is only responsible to God and to history, not to any lesser body. After all, Poland was free because of Rydz-Śmigły's decisive actions. Without one man rising to heed the call of history, would there even be the new Poland?"

The Councils have taken control of many border regions with improvised militias.\n\nThere has been little resistance, both because of the complete disarray of the German army, but also because of Wojciech Korfanty's address to the Germans, especially German Catholics, where he portrayed the conflict as a supra-national Christian cause, where Germans and Poles are both on a righteous crusade against the syndicalists.\n\nMany Germans in Poznań, Danzig and the other border regions have expressed their support for Korfanty's idea.

This means reducing the political influence of unreliable citizens prone to agitation and radicalism. Socialist trade unions and the Bund, radical Centrolew-aligned organisations ran with Jewish money, syndicalists and other fringe extremists - all of these must be removed from the public sphere. Democracy is only as good as its worst voter.\n\nThe new electoral reform is already in works, which will hopefully reduce the political influence of the socialists. However, there is debate on how far we should go in these measures to safeguard our Polish Christian democracy. The party has many legalists who wish to stay purely on the legal path, but the bolder voices argue that extensive use of secret police will be needed to counter the foreign support to our radicals."

To oppose these plans, a large amount of senators from the ruling parties have presented the prime minister with a demand - he has to moderate his proposal, or face a full-blown parliamentary revolt."

A large amount of MKP and ChZJN senators are refusing to support Ćwiakowski, even though he enjoys thin support in the lower house. According to the Polish constitution, the prime minister cannot be voted out - but he also cannot enact laws without support of the both houses. As Ćwiakowski seems uncompromising, the only path forward is his resignation, or his dismissal by the king.\n\nIn the privy council, the king has been urged to remove the \"peasant minister\" and to appoint someone more \"politically responsible.\" Eustachy Sapieha, a long-term senator of the MKP and a pre-eminent nobleman to boot, has been suggested as the next Prime Minister. Alternatively, the king might have leverage to create a compromise between Ćwiakowski and the nobility."

In addition, all monarchist or anti-revolutionary organisations must be disbanded, the army demobilised, and a supervisory board of generals from France and Britain will be allowed to oversee Poland's transformation into a syndicalist democracy.\n\nIn exchange for this, the Third Internationale will extend their protection to us and ensure that the Russians cannot exploit our moment of weakness... but looking at the harsh terms of the treaty, one has to ask, have we simply traded a German master for a [INT.GetAdjective] one?"
 poland.275.d.rus: "The Russians have been rather graceful in their demands. They have accepted to honour both the current eastern borders of Poland, and the current government of [POL.GetSecondInCommand]. However, they demand immediate demobilisation of Poland's armed forces, and the trial of war criminals and \"German collaborators,\" overseen by a council of Russian military and civilian officials. They have also demanded the Sejm to ratify joining the Moscow Accord to protect [POL.GetNameDef] from the Revolutionary tide swooping from the West.\n\nWhile many see the treaty as the best possible ending for this hopeless war, not everyone trusts the promises of the Russians - many still remember the Polish fight for freedom against Tsarist Russia decades back, and it is not a memory that strikes trust between the two peoples."

A reminder that it had been the once-celebrated Centrolew government that had driven Poland into the futile war in the first place, only threw more fuel into the fire. Behind closed doors, the ambassadors from Paris and London made it clear that Poland's fate hangs on the election and the government formed afterwards.\n\nAfter a depressingly low turnout, and palpable apathy towards the elections, a new syndicalist government has been appointed, led by [POL.GetSecondInCommand].

We have cooperated with the Polish National Democrats to this common goal, and many in our government believe that Poland governed by them would fit our vision better.\n\nPressuring Poland to arrange new elections, one that Adam Doboszyński's men will win, would be relatively simple feat in the current world situation."

The war-time ruling parties were denounced for all the death and destruction caused by the war, and Endecja politicians portrayed themselves as the only sensible option that would both protect Poland from the encroaching socialism coming from the west, and to ensure Russian cooperation.\n\nIn a depressing election under immense foreign pressure, the National Party won a landslide, with Adam Doboszyński elected as the president with strong executive powers.

The Bank of Poland, independent of the government, held a sizable amount of German government bonds that had been used to stabilise the Polish market during the past few years.\n\nWith the current turn of events, this proved to be a horrible decision, as a major part of the bank's reserve stock lost all of its value, sending our currency into freefall.

 poland.305.d: "As it so happens, Germany has decided to abandon their lordship over the Polish State Railways after the KPuGHStE, the Prussian railway conglomerate, could not keep the railway running due to the massive economic downturn and a lack of funds. This railway route is perhaps the single most important railway for Germany, connecting the Kaiserreich proper to her Oststaaten.\n\nThe Polish government is planning to buy the route themselves, but should we decide to, we could buy the majority ownership with loans. While expensive in the middle of the crisis, this move would greatly increase our influence in the Polish economy, and in turn reduce Berlin's sway over them."
 poland.305.a: "This is hardly the time!"

 poland.306.t: "The Fate of the German-owned Railways" #for POL
 poland.306.d: "The Polish railway network is managed by the Polish crown company KWiP (Królewskie Koleje Współpracy i Postępu), which is largely owned by a German subsidiary of the KPuGHStE (Königlich Preußische und Großherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahn), a Prussian government railway company. This arrangement has secured German oversight over the vital transportation route to the Oststaaten, but also supple funding from Germany, securing thousands of jobs for Poles.\n\nWith a dramatically reduced need for traffic and cuts to the KPuGHStE budget, the railway's fate is now uncertain. With thousands of railway workers unemployed, we are under tremendous pressure to buy the corporation out from Prussian hands. This would be very expensive and comparable to nationalisation, but it would let us secure the railway workers' jobs - and of course give us full control of the highly strategic transportation route."
 poland.306.a: "This is our chance to buy it."
 poland.306.b: "It's called free trade for a reason."

 poland.307.d: "With a lack of government buying, KPuGHStE has sold their major share of the Polish State Railways, KWiP. This has led to the free-fall of KWiP funds, and a constantly worsening financial situation, forcing the company to fire a large part of its workers.\n\nNeedless to say, this is both an economic catastrophe for Poland and a great setback to German designs to keep the Polish economy on a tight leash."

 poland.309.d: "It was announced that a major [FROM.GetAdjective] industrial conglomerate is expanding their business in Poland. Some say that foreign corporations already control too much of our economy, but they are ignoring the obvious upsides of such deals: the factories will bring countless new jobs to the Polish people, and with jobs they can support their families and stay out of radical movements."
 poland.309.a: "Business is booming."
 poland.309.b: "No deal."

 poland.310.t: "Pro-German Sentiment"
 poland.310.d: "Despite our troubled relations with our great western neighbour, many Poles have started to see a good relationship with Berlin as a safeguard for work and security.\n\nA German-Polish Friendship Association has been especially vocal in organising charitable and cultural events, celebrating the shared history of Poland and Germany, such as their common struggle against Swedish Imperialism in the 17th century, and the common fight against Tsarist tyranny in the Weltkrieg. These pro-German campaigns have drawn ire from the opposition, as usual."

 poland.311.t: "Major Factories Close Down"
 poland.311.d: "A major industrial conglomerate has announced their plans to shut down their factory, leaving approximately 200 workers unemployed as a result.\n\nA reason they have cited is the cheaper costs of labour elsewhere. It is expected for them to move their business to Ukraine, or perhaps White Ruthenia, where labour is even cheaper than in Poland. There is little we can do to make them stay."

 poland.313.d.pol: "In the aftermath of the economic depression, many German businesses withdrew from Poland, and many of these industries were later nationalised by the government. Despite their cost, the etatist policies enacted have moved much of the Polish economy into the control of the state, and Polish conglomerates such as \"Lewiatan\". The reintroduction of the zloty, and other high-profile nationalisations, have further strengthened Poland's financial position\n\nEven Berlin recognised this massive shift in Poland in our renegotiations of the German-Polish trade agreements, and accepted it as a fait accomplii - after all, an economically prospering Poland is to their advantage in any case, even if many German corporations lost much of their investments in there - but that story is hardly unique to Poland. Finally, Poland has broken free from its economic bondage."
 poland.313.d.ger: "After the economic crash and depression, the Polish economy only managed to stay afloat through their close connections to the economic powerhouses of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As they started to recover, the entirety of Mitteleuropa did so with them, Poland being one of the first.\n\nNow with the worst economic crisis and the chaotic elections are behind us, it's time to focus on stability and building a solid foundation for future economic cooperation in Central Europe."

Exercises between countries of the Reichspakt are not uncommon at all, and we share a lot of the same equipment and training, mostly thanks to our friends in Berlin.\n\nIn this light their plan is nothing strange, and in the constantly darkening international situation, especially with growing Russian revanchism, additional exercises seem justified.\n\nShould we accept, they are also interested in more in-depth branch-specific training that could greatly hone our tactics and practical technology."

 poland.333.d.inf: "A major joint exercise was launched today between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] forces. The manoeuvres were focused on the modern usage of infantry as both a defensive and offensive force.\n\nDespite the new technologies of the 30s, the backbone of our armies will always be the man and his rifle - and it is critical for us to refine the tactics learned from the Weltkrieg into something modern and dynamic, capable of standing against the modernised Russian army once again."
 poland.333.d.art: "Major joint exercises were launched today between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] forces. The manoeuvres were focused on modern artillery and radio targeting systems.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, artillery proved its importance as the uncrowned King of the battlefield, and with that philosophy we must further advance our artillery tactics. It is the best force multiplier we have against the massive Russian army - and it should remain that way."
 poland.333.d.arm: "A major joint exercise was launched today between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] forces. The manoeuvres were focused on the most modern branch of our armies - armoured columns.\n\nThere are many conflicting ideas on how armour should be deployed even among our own high command, and major armoured exercises like these are good chances to hone our understanding of armoured warfare, combined arms doctrine and the practical capabilities of armour models. If we are to survive the inevitable Russian onslaught, we need to make up for their numbers with superior technology and tactics."

 poland.334.d: "After a thorough analysis of our exercises and technology sharing with our allies, we have identified some aspects of our current military that can be easily improved. The exercise has also taught our commanders practical lessons on using modern equipment in the harsh regions of Eastern Europe.\n\nDespite the occasional inter-cultural clash among the common soldiers, the exercise was considered to be a success by both high commands."
 poland.334.a: "Interesting."

 poland.335.t: "The Appointment of the General Inspector"
 poland.335.d: "As professional as the Polish Army may be in comparison to its fellow members of the Reichspakt, a series of reports made by the Ministry of Defence throughout the 30s has spurred the creation of a programme for the general modernisation of the Army. The first task of the programme would be the formation of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces, an office which reports directly to the head of state and oversees the modernisation of the military, while also serving the role of commander-in-chief in the case of war.\n\nThe Germans, unsurprisingly, push forward the candidacy of Heinz Guderian. While giving a German such a high role in the Army would be a risky move, he is a brilliant visionary and his ideas of mobile warfare have been applauded by many as the next step forward in warfare.\n\nKazimierz Sosnkowski is another reputable choice, a genius organiser and an intellectual, palatable to many of the factions in the government. A third option would be the uncontroversial Leon Berbecki, whose tireless work is to thank for the good shape of the Polish army nowadays. He is both reasonably popular as a former Legionary, but also among those who cooperated very early with the monarchy."

The original 8TP has improved upon the original in almost every regard, but it has since been shown to be outdated in just as many ways. The new 9-tonne tank is aimed to improve upon its predecessor, but instead of a general-purpose vehicle, the designers are divided between two visions.\n\nThe Polish lead designer, Edward Habich, has proposed multiple improvements to vehicle's armour, believing that 9TP's function should be infantry support, like its predecessors. Heinz Guderian is proposing to focus on mobility instead, by saving on armour but installing more powerful engines and radios to the units."

 poland.337.a: "Of course we will help them."

 poland.350.t: "The German Labour Cooperation"
 poland.350.d: "A project of dubious morality was started today as the German Ministry of Economy opened the Deutsch-Polnische Zusammenarbeit, an initiative that has been sugar-coated as a wonderful opportunity for the Poles to satisfy the needs of the ever-thirsting German war industry by working in heavy industry, mining and forestry, mainly in the Prussian and Silesian regions.\n\nFor some, it has brought back memories of the Weltkrieg-era forced labour that the Germans recruited from occupied Poland, but this time Berlin has been much more tactful and have promised decent wages - at least compared to the Polish ones - and naturally a way to dodge military service. Joining is purely done on a voluntary basis, though Berlin has been clear that if the soft means do not work, then harsher methods of persuasion will be utilised."

 poland.351.d: "Germany has intensified their recruitment efforts for the German-Polish Labour Cooperation, and has even made deals to use Polish prisoners to alleviate the constant manpower need of German war industry.\n\nMany of the urban poor have already taken up the offer, and found work in Prussian forestry and agriculture, though a number of scandals about mistreatment of the workers has dimmed the popularity of the work exchange a bit."
 poland.351.a: "They know best."

 poland.352.t: "Decreasing D.P.Z. Recruiting"
 poland.352.d: "Thanks to recent events, less foreign workers have been needed in German industries lately, leading to an influx of exchange workers returning to Poland.\n\nThere are hopes that the recruitment will remain low, as it has become more and more unpopular as it has dragged on, and for now the government has scored a victory."
 poland.352.a: "Alright."

 poland.353.t: "Unrest against the German Labour Cooperation"
 poland.353.d: "The nation has been shocked by revelations published by the newspaper Robotnik, documenting numerous accounts from Polish workers in Germany detailing their poor treatment, withdrawn pay and false promises by their German managers. Despite the workers being volunteers, the case has generated major outrage, and a delegation from the PPS officially requested the Prime Minister to launch an investigation into the matter\n\nThe more German-minded politicians would rather keep silent about the entire matter, disregarding it as a collection of singular cases of disappointments that do not reflect the labour exchange as a whole. In any case, the people are demanding something to be done."

 poland.353.b: "Negotiate better terms with the Germans, then."

 poland.354.t: "Agricultural Exports to [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 poland.354.d: "[FROM.GetName] has petitioned us to direct more of our agricultural products to their populations, explaining how we need to work together to beat the hardship of the war. Having realised the vulnerability of major cities already in the first Weltkrieg, [FROM.GetAdjective] are now trying to secure enough grain for their urban population from vast farmlands of Eastern Europe.\n\n They are paying us a lot worse than our farmers could get from private markets - but then again, it is for the common cause, is it not?"

They are requesting our government to support them as the new Lithuanian government, formed by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, has started blatant Lithuanisation policies in the country's multi-ethnic south.\n\nThe Poles and Belarusians claim that these attempts are unconstitutional and tyrannical, and have pleaded the Polish government to support them against Antanas Smetona's designs to fully end the autonomy of the Białystok region, and other ethnic autonomies in Lithuania."
 poland.360.a: "Demand an explanation from Smetona's government."
 poland.360.b: "It's their problem."

 poland.361.d: "The Polish Ambassador delivered a politely worded letter from [POL.GetLeader] to us today.\n\nThey have the nerve to demand an explanation concerning the treatment of Poles in southern Lithuania, and invoke some earlier treaties where [POL.GetNameDef] was defined as one of the observers to ensure that Lithuanian ethnic minorities are treated justly."
 poland.361.a: "In Lithuania we obey Lithuanian laws!"

 poland.362.t: "Smetona Uncooperative"
 poland.362.d: "The response we received from Lithuania was anything but satisfactory.\n\nIn it, Prime Minister Smetona assured that Lithuanian laws will be followed in the entirety of Lithuania, and that foreign countries should not concern themselves with what are Lithuanian domestic issues."
 poland.362.a: "Two can play this game. Send troops to\nthe border."
 poland.362.b: "We did what the delegation asked of us."

 poland.363.t: "Polish Mobilisation!"
 poland.363.d: "It seems like the Poles are not joking. Our military intelligence reported that a Polish division has been concentrated to our border near Białystok. Obviously they claim it to be \"an exercise\", but we understand that it is a blatant attempt to intimidate us into negotiations.\n\nHowever, the Poles in Białystok have been greatly emboldened by the act, and the unrest has been growing every day. There are also rumours that the Polish army has been covertly in contact with the separatist Polish organisations. If something is not done, we might have full uprising in our hands."

 poland.364.d: "After Antanas Smetona became the Lithuanian prime minister, his government has pursued aggressive Lithuanisation policies, including the abolishment of the autonomous regions that had previously been given to Lithuania's numerous minorities. While normally we would not care less of such domestic politics, it seems that the situation has escalated greatly.\n\nBoth Polish and Lithuanian armies have brought troops and equipment to the border, and Białystok is openly resisting the Lithuanian government. The entire situation has turned incredibly messy, and incidents like these almost make many wish that we would not have to act as the judge in the squabbles of the Eastern European states."

 poland.365.d: "It would appear that the government in Berlin is not at all pleased. Polish forces were ordered to stand down, which was eventually obeyed following considerable protestation.\n\nWhat followed was a harsh crack-down of the Białystok resistance, as the Lithuanian military and police arranged mass arrests to pacify the situation."

 poland.365.c: "Another feather for Smetona's cap!"

 poland.366.t: "The Birth of the Białystok Resistance"
 poland.366.d: "Calming the situation was not as easy as the Lithuanian law enforcement imagined, it seems. During the past few months, the opposite has happened. Poles, Jews and Belarusians are all passively resisting of our Lithuanisation policies, and there seems to be increasing radicalisation among them. There have already been some incidents of arms smuggling, worryingly similar to what the Activist Front has been previously doing.\n\nOur intelligence seems to point out that much of the resistance organisation is funded and directed from the Polish side, to where many leading figures have escaped. Poland has not been willing to extradite them, which leaves us with little choices but to squash the resistance through increasingly tightening law enforcement."

 poland.367.t: "German Ultimatum to Smetona"
 poland.367.d: "The LTS government had not been worried, as they believed that the Germans would not defend the Poles, not with their own issues with minorities. Perhaps they ignored how much the word of King August IV carried weight in Germany, as Berlin seems to have taken the Polish side on the issue.\n\nThe Germans criticise Smetona's policies for their incompetence, and his failing to maintain stability in the Kingdom of Lithuania. In very plain words, they demand Lithuanian forces to stand down, respect the existing autonomies, and stop inciting unrest in a strategically important region."

 poland.368.d: "As neither side has budged, constantly growing unrest in Białystok finally reached the tipping point. A general strike was called, and the protesters barricaded factories and streets all across the city. The unrest spread to the surrounding Polish countryside like wildfire, and sympathy strikes were arranged as far as in Vilnius.\n\nWith the fears that the Belarusians will soon join the fight, Lithuanian forces used force to scatter the crowd gathered at the Kościuszko Square. Shots were fired, and the Poles in the Lithuanian army started to desert en masse. The situation grew worse every day, and Polish troops that were posted to the border were witnesses to the revolutionary mood, and started demanding that they should intervene to protect their countrymen.\n\nIn a last ditch intervention, King [LIT.GetLeader] made a public appearance, and as the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian forces, he ordered them away from the border to de-escalate the situation. In the same address, he called upon his counterpart in Poland with assurances that the situation would be solved diplomatically. Antanas Smetona is furious, having counted the King as either an ally, or at least a harmless figurehead."

Polish representatives were joined by their counterparts from [WHR.GetName], who joined in the complaints about Smetona's government's war on their culture. While Lithuanian delegates argued that the issue is merely domestic, and that even Germany does not have the legal right to change Lithuanian laws, King [LIT.GetLeader] made the decisive choice to suggest a referendum in the relevant regions.\n\nSuch a suggestion was of course seen as treason by the LTS and many Lithuanians, and seen as validation to claims that the king is truly a German, not a Lithuanian. In the end, Lithuanian negotiators had no choice but to accept, even if the outcome of the referendum seemed obvious to everyone."

 poland.380.t: "The Money behind the [POL_Government]"
 poland.380.d: "The tabloid \"Secret Detective\" is infamous for publishing details of crimes and scandals in Poland. Its sensationalist style led to it quickly rising to prominence, following the liberalisation of the previous restrictions on the press. Most often it is merely entertainment of poor taste - graphic descriptions of murders, suggestive gossip from the high society and so on, with the magazine being criticised particularly vehemently by the Church and the political right. Their most serious article thus far was published on the last Tuesday, where they published very specific details about certain ministers, senators and judges taking bribes from Lewiatan's associates.\n\nWhile corruption is nothing new, this case is on an entirely new scale. If the magazine's claims are true, then it seems that Lewiatan, an association of Polish investors and industrialists that is among the most powerful lobbies in Polish politics, has been conducting large-scale bribing of government officials, to push their anti-regulatory and anti-workers' rights agenda. In part, this was an open secret, but the scale of it, and the sensationalist style of it, has created publicity that is causing quite a stir among the people. At worst, this could empower our opposition greatly."

 poland.381.d: "During the elections, the Centrolew parties focused much on corruption and the pro-business lobby. Now that they are in power, some anti-corruption investigations have been already been launched already, and there are also plans for nationalisations. Collectively, these are making the members of Lewiatan, an association of Polish investors and industrialists, understandably wary of the new government.\n\nSome of the Lewiatan leadership such as Warsaw-based banker Czesław Klarner have announced their intentions to fund the opposition parties, as protest to the \"irresponsible economic actions\" of our current government. However, in less public channels, Lewiatan's contacts have suggested that perhaps some kind of compromise could be reached, and with sufficient \"freedoms\" given, they could support our government, just like they previously supported its last MKP-led iteration."

Carried out on the orders of [POL.GetSecondInCommand], the police hit the homes of a few dozen Sejm delegates and transported them to the Rakowiecka Prison in Warsaw, infamous for being used by the Okhrana to jail political dissidents.\n\nThey have been accused of inciting the peasant uprising of 1937, inciting disobedience towards the authorities, organising anti-state protests and preparing to overthrow the legal government. Among the accused there are famous socialist and liberal politicians like Norbert Barlicki, Stanisław Dubois and Maksymilian Malinowski.\n\nWith the arrests, entire leadership of the Centrolew has been practically decimated.

## Land Reforms
#Moderate land reform
 poland.440.t: "The Land Consolidation Act"
 poland.440.d: "While most agree that Polish agricultural production is riddled with inefficiency, inequality and social issues, the actual solutions vary drastically. Many landowners are not openly hostile towards selling their excess land to the government, who will then distribute it to the landless - but the question of what exactly is considered \"excess land\" has no easy answer.\n\nA relatively high value of 400 hectares has been suggested, and is especially popular among the old szlachta, who own the most land in the Kingdom - and even more popular is a limit of 400 hectares, but with exemptions for noble landowners. The opposing voice comes from the Germans in the Privy Council, who argue that more drastic reform is needed, but with the possibility of landowners keeping their land in exchange for monetary compensation to the state, in order to not be seen as unreasonable. This option is naturally favoured by wealthier Germans, who generally own less land - and opposed by the szlachta.\n\nWhich proposal shall we listen to?"
 poland.440.a: "400 hectares, with exemptions." #what poles want
 poland.440.b: "400 hectares, with no exemptions."
 poland.440.c: "150 hectares, with the possibility of compensation." #what germans want
#ChZJN land reform
 poland.441.t: "The Land Consolidation Act"
 poland.441.d: "White Ruthenia has been a great example of the dangers of socialism, even in \"moderate\" quantities. The BSDP's radical reforms have been a source of constant unrest and injustice towards the old landowners, as they have been used to justify stripping many successful farmers of their entire life's work, just to empower \"the little man\". Our land reform has to avoid these issues, while still giving the loyal peasants enough land to sustain their way of life.\n\nMany major magnates have accepted the selling of parts of their land to the government, to be distributed to the peasants, but unfortunately some forceful measures will be needed. An easy solution would be to focus on Jewish properties first and foremost - but only doing that will limit the scope of the reform somewhat."
 poland.441.a: "Only break up the estates owned by non-Poles."
 poland.441.b: "The Poles have to sell the excess land, too."
#Radical land reform
 poland.442.t: "The Redistribution of Farmland"
 poland.442.d: "When [POL.GetRulingParty] came to power, we had a promise: to empower the Polish peasant, the basic unit of any healthy nation. And with our massively ambitious programme to finish the lacklustre reforms of the past, we intend to slay the hydra of the great land magnates once and for all, like our brothers in Galicia did a century ago.\n\nWe shall confiscate the massive fields held by corrupt noblemen, those who have so many times sold their nation to the foreign invaders. We shall also break apart the great estates held by the Prussian elites, acquired with deceit, and ran with the toil of Polish peasants."

 poland.444.t: "Kielce-Pressburg Line Opened" # Hungary/Austria
 poland.444.d: "With their heavy investment in Hungarian railways, the Hungarian government has had an ongoing interest in the developing our connections to their own country, Hungary of course being pioneers in railway development, and having the most international railways connections in the world. When the Polish Railway Authorities approached the Hungarian State Railways to establish a number of new international connections, the MAV were highly interested.\n\nOf these lines, the biggest connection would be the Kielce-Pressburg line. Passing through Kraków in Galicia, the line will terminate in Pressburg, Hungary and offer travellers connections to other Hungarian railways, or to transit onto Austria via Vienna, or down South into the Balkan states."
 poland.444.a: "To Transcarpathian cooperation!"

 poland.445.t: "Warschau-Posen Line Modernised" # Germany
 poland.445.d: "Today, an express service originating from Warschau Centralna arrived at Posen Main, signalling the conclusion of the Warsachu-Posen Line modernisation works, as part of Poland's effort to modernise their aging railway system.\n\nThe German province of Posen has traditionally held a close link with Poland, given its noticeable Polish population, as well as serving as a midway point between the Polish railway and the rail terminal in Berlin, which is a valuable asset to the Polish and German government alike. However, the railway line has been plagued by its aging infrastructure built in the late 19th century, lacking the repairs and modernisation needed to support the faster, heavier and more frequent trains that have been running since the rise of Mitteleuropa. \n\nFor the past few months, workmen have been working overtime to finish the modernisation work quickly and minimise disruption. Railway lines along the Warschau-Posen Line have been upgraded and modernised, reinforcing bridges and track sleepers along the line as well as implementing modern signalling systems. The conclusion of the project is expected to bring Poland further into Mitteleuropa, by bringing Warsaw closer to Berlin, and its success has undoubtedly brought valuable experience in modernising infrastructure shared by multiple nations."
 poland.445.a: "A great success!"

 poland.446.t: "Expansion of the Warschau-Danzig Line" # Germany
 poland.446.d: "As one of the biggest ports on the Baltic Sea, Danzig has been one of the most common destinations for Polish businessmen, tourists and goods alike, becoming Poland's window to the wider world. With Poland pursuing closer ties with the rest of Mitteleuropa, train traffic along the Warschau-Danzig line has increased significantly to the brink of overloading the railway line.\n\nPreviously, the railway tracks along the line had been limited to serving a dozen trains per day, due to a limited rail capacity and low train speed. Due to its economic importance for Poland, the line has been on the forefront for expansion, and only now has the comprehensive expansion concluded.\n\nThe stretch of rail has been completely revamped, adding additional tracks to support heavier and more frequent railways. This effort is intended to increase Poland's capacity for both the import and export of goods, and is expected to bring a notable increase in trade not only to Poland, but also bring sizable additional revenue to the port of Danzig through tariffs."
 poland.446.a: "To further cooperation!"

 poland.447.t: "Polish-Silesian Line Expanded" # Germany
 poland.447.d: "As one of the earliest railway lines built in Silesia, the Oberschlesische Eisenbahn has served the Prussian government since the mid-1840s. The line since then has been modernised multiple times to serve heavy traffic from Silesia. As one of the three main train hubs that connect Poland to Germany, the Polish section of the Polish-Silesian Line has constantly been criticised for being unable to support a large number of passenger and cargo trains, due to the limited capacity on its aging tracks.\n\nWith the high economic priority of the railway, investments were made by the Polish government to expand its tracks. Since the Polish government started work on improving and expanding multiple stretches of railway, and operating more railway lines to better connect them with neighbouring nations, the expansion of the Polish-Silesian Line was inevitable.\n\nCoordinating with the Railway Authorities, a new stretch of track bypassing much of the old infrastructure was built, offering express trains as a faster and more direct route to Poland's main cities, such as Łódź and Warsaw. In addition, plans for further improvement to the rail were drawn up, including the electrification, with electric locomotives to taking over the duty of the heavy coal trains originating from Silesia."
 poland.447.a: "To further cooperation!"

 poland.448.t: "Modernisation of Kielce-Kraków Line" # Galicia-Lodomeria/Austria
 poland.448.d: "To further strengthen the ties with our own nation, Poland has put considerable work into modernising the Kielce-Kraków railway. The project, started a few months ago, has just concluded. The one hundred kilometre long stretch of track is one of the most crucial railways in Poland, connecting the Polish railway network to Southern Europe and the Balkans, being second in annual traffic only to the Warschau-Danzig railway.\n\nThe modernisation of the Kielce-Kraków railway includes constructing new bypasses for express passenger trains, as well as implementing modern signalling systems. The modernisation is expected to increase the throughput rate of the railway by fifty percent."
 poland.448.a: "A great success!"

 poland.449.t: "Kielce-Teschen Line" # Bohemia/Austria
 poland.449.d: "Situated on the border between Bohemia and Poland, Teschen is one of the main connections between the two nations' railway network. The lack of a direct railway link between our closest railway hub in Kielce has annoyed investors and travellers alike. The establishment of the Kielce-Teschen Line aims to remedy the issue and provide a link."
 poland.449.a: "To further cooperation!"

 poland.450.t: "Renovation of Warsaw-Białystok Route" # Lithuania
 poland.450.d: "The stretch of track connecting Warsaw to Białystok has been a crucial part of the international railways connecting Poland to the Baltic states. While strategically less important than routes to Ukraine, its economic importance for both Poland and Lithuania is immense, as the two countries are deeply intertwined in trade and movement of goods."
 poland.450.a: "Wonderful."

 poland.451.t: "Expansion of Warsaw-Wilno Line" # Lithuania
 poland.451.d: "The Polish-German corporations have finished the modernisation of the Warsaw-Białystok-Vilnius line, further tying Lithuania to the Central European economy. It has been celebrated as a symbol of Polish-Lithuanian cooperation."
 poland.451.a: "Another example of Polish-Lithuanian friendship."

 poland.452.t: "Warsaw-Riga Route" # UBD
 poland.452.d: "With less volatility over the future of the Baltic states, trade has been steadily increasing, and demands for a route that leaves for the Baltic states has followed suit. As part of the Railway Expansion project, a new international route has been established with Latvia, connecting the cities of Warsaw and Riga, the industrial centre of the Baltic States.\n\nThe Route departs Warsaw every two days, and passes Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, before turning for Riga at Daugavpils, terminating at Riga Central Station. The railway line cuts down on the time taken by more than three hours, as well as eliminating the necessity to change trains at Danzig."
 poland.452.a: "Wonderful."

 poland.453.t: "New line connects Lemberg to Lublin" # Galicia-Lodomeria/Austria
 poland.453.d: "The newest product of Polish-Austrian economic cooperation is the brand new expansion of the Lemberg-Lublin railway. Movement between [POL.GetNameDef] and the Crownland has always been frequent, and additional rail volume has been sorely needed to account for increases in trade."
 poland.453.a: "Good."

 poland.454.t: "Warsaw-Brest Route Expanded" # Ukraine
 poland.454.d: "Despite stormy Polish-Ukrainian relations, our cooperation has benefited both of us during the past few decades. With second line from Warsaw to Brest - and beyond, to Kiev - hopefully transportation will be eased. The project has been well received both by businesses and most of all, by the Ukrainian military, as it improves logistics between Germany and the Russian front."
 poland.454.a: "Good."

 poland.455.t: "New Warsaw-Kiev Railway" # Ukraine
 poland.455.d: "Previously, trains intending to terminate at Kiev from Germany had to take lengthy detours via other members of Mitteleuropa due to the poor state of Polish railways, plaguing the route with delays, as express trains passing through Poland are required to limit their top speed and even pull aside on antiquated sidings.\n\nAs of now, the newly-opened Warsaw-Kiev Railway intends to pull the two nations closer together by linking the capitals with an express railway, shortening the time taken for the Berlin-Kiev Express from upwards of forty eight hours passing through four nations, to a mere eighteen hours with a single stop. Built to a heightened standard, the tracks support trains up to ten thousand tonnes and a top speed of two hundred and forty kilometres an hour.\n\nWhile it is not expected for trains to immediately be able to fully utilise the potential of the rail now, the high potential for the tracks are intended to serve more powerful locomotives projected to be developed within the decade, as well as the heavier freight trains heading to and from Ukraine and the Caucasus. The railway management body expects to be required to serve ten trains in each direction at any point of the day, including both passenger and cargo trains. "
 poland.455.a: "A symbol of Polish-Ukrainian cooperation."

 poland.456.t: "Warsaw-Minsk Route Opened" # White Ruthenia
 poland.456.d: "In a joint Polish-Belarusian project, railway connections between our two nations have been improved drastically. Improved infrastructure should ease White Ruthenia's trade with the rest of Mitteleuropa - and should the situation come to the worst, help our allies to stand together against Russia."
 poland.456.a: "Good."

 poland.466.t: "Increasing Rural Literacy"
 poland.466.d: "Historically the formerly Russian-controlled, or, \"Congress\" Poland had an abysmal literacy rate. For a long time, there was no mandatory education, and when there was, it was tainted by the goals of Russification. This was in stark contrast with \"German Poland\" and \"Austrian Poland\", both of which had relatively good literacy and organised education systems since the 19th century.\n\nDue to the strong pro-education policies of our past governments, immigration of educated Poles from Belarus and Germany, and the tireless work of Polish cultural elite, our independent Poland is finally nearing Poznań or Kraków in literacy."

The King and his Cabinet had assured that there was no reason to worry, but everyone knew how Polish units had been discreetly turned back to the homeland, as if to prepare for the final defence against the Russians. Despite von Kries's arguments, the Polish generals and King's ministers had convinced August to prepare Poland's eastern borders instead of fighting a war in further east, though the returning Polish units did seem to calm the minds of King's subjects.\n\nLittle did he know that this was the first move planned by the conspirators within his army and in his government. And had he looked closer, he might have realised that many spoke of the Russians not with fear, but with cautious hope. As the Bear marched closer, it started to be seen more as a liberator instead of a conqueror day by day, as Adam Doboszyński's National Committee had already been smuggled into the Kingdom proper by sympathetic Poles. August IV was sitting on a powderkeg, and the only thing it needed was a spark."

The few Royal Guards who wouldn't let the men pass were shot by the attackers, and the King was intercepted while trying to escape the capital with a band of loyalists, though to prevent further bloodshed, August IV ordered his men to lay down their arms. The King was imprisoned in his Palace to await the nation's judgement.\n\nThe following day was chaotic as the entire nation rose up, and most of the Polish army joined the newly declared \"Polish National Republic.\" General Rydz-Śmigły declared the army's support for the uprising, as nationalist underground cells sprang up and secured the control of the countryside.

 poland.540.t: "An Alliance with the PPS?"
 poland.540.d: "The Polish Socialist Party has been in the forefront of Polish liberation in every uprising since its inception, and [GetYear] is no exception. The unions aligned to the PPS have already started gathering arms and organising militia units to keep order in the cities, and more workers are flocking to their banners every day.\n\nTheir leadership has thus far been wary of us, seeing our government as too radical and too connected to foreign governments to be true government of liberation to the people of Poland - but they have been open for negotiations, understanding that cooperation might be the only way Poland will survive the coming storm."
 poland.540.a: "Very well, they can organise their militias."
 poland.540.b: "And stab us in the back given the chance? No way!"

 poland.541.t: "Cooperation with the ONR"
 poland.541.d: "The National Radical Camp has quickly improvised numerous fighting organisations, no different from their peacetime marches - except that this time they are well-armed. This group of ultranationalists, the self-declared shining vanguard of Poland's national resurrection, has already taken part in fighting, engaging with both the Germans and the supporters of the old order.\n\nThe methods of the ONR are extreme, and they would make a dangerous ally that is hard to control - but an ally nonetheless. Even if the distrust between them and our government is mutual, in the end we can trust these men to give their lives for Poland."

 poland.542.d: "Already active in the days of the Weltkrieg, the Riflemen's Association has been the school for the most brilliant soldiers Poland has seen in the 20th century.\n\nThe nominally apolitical society is focused on patriotic education, charity, and cultivating Polish culture, alongside paramilitary training. Despite it being used to spread the monarchy's propaganda during the past two decades, in its heart, it is still the vanguard of Polish liberation, as first envisioned by Józef Piłsudski and Kazimierz Zakrzewski.\n\nArise, riflemen!"

 poland.543.t: "Defections and Desertions"
 poland.543.d: "When it was clear that Warsaw was lost, the still loyal elements of the army began their contingency plan - the Poznań Bridgehead. The intent of the plan was to regroup for a counterattack, should a force hostile to Poland take over the nation. And now that has happened, to the horror of both Polish and German planners - and worse still, a major part of the Polish Army has simply refused to retreat, either deserting their post, or even joining with the radicals who have taken over much of the country.\n\nThose still loyal to lawful government have retreated west, towards Prussian Poland, with the intent to regroup with the Germans, and drive away the radicals who have taken over their homeland."

 poland.544.d: "In the early hours of this morning, in the small village of Szrénsk, Endecja militants opened fire on the men of the 2nd Red Guard from Płock, leading to a dozen deaths and even more wounded, before they were forced to retreat. Both sides claimed having confused the enemy with the Germans, but it is unlikely the fighting would have gone for so long if this was the case.\n\nThis is not the first time such events have happened, either - ever since our strenuous alliance, there have been tensions which have often turned into fights, after agitation by overzealous commanders at the front. However, the skirmish at Szrénsk was the most serious of these conflicts thus far, and has given us reason to reconsider our alliance with our ideological enemies."
 poland.544.a: "From now on, we shall treat them as enemies of the revolution!"

 poland.545.d: "A rival government has been declared by the Worker's and Peasant's Councils of Łódź, Kielce and number of other southern regions that still harbour strong loyalties towards the PPS and PSL. The militias aligned to these parties, mainly composed of the peasants of Lesser Poland, have rallied behind Jan Woznicki and his \"earnest government\", which has declared itself the true Polish revolutionary government, one that is not a puppet directed from Paris.\n\nWhile their support is merely regional at the moment, they might become a major issue if we let them gather strength and build up their anti-syndicalist forces."

 poland.546.t: "The formation of the Citizens' Militia"
 poland.546.d: "The Polish Army was designed as a tool of oppression: it was the twisted corpse of Józef Piłsudski's Legions, there to uphold an illegal German puppet government, and the interests of landowners and corporatists. That army is all but broken, with many defections, desertions and the total collapse of military organisation.\n\nIn its place, a true revolutionary Polish army shall rise, born out of peasants and workers, and guided by the belief of a free and independent Poland! Like our brothers in France and so many other nations, we have finally taken the fate in our own hands!"

 poland.547.d: "The Royal Polish Army was mere a mockery of the proud Legions that marched two decades ago. Cronyism, favouritism and Prussian influences had twisted it, and made it forget its true loyalties and instead harnessed the ancient Polish martial prowess into a slave army under the German whip. No more!\n\nAfter all the defections and desertions, the old army is all but broken, and only its core of the true patriots is left. We must once again draw armies from the ground, calling every able-bodied Pole to defend their fatherland against the Prussian tyrants!"

 poland.549.d: "Today the government was contacted by formerly criminal underground organisation, the elusive ZRP, the Order of the Knights of the Law. A secretive patriotic lodge styled after the Freemasons, has been out of the public eye since the 20s, but with the ongoing uprising and its leadership being like-minded to ourselves, they have approached the authorities once again.\n\nThe head of the Convention of the Knights, Władysław Józefowicz, has brought an offer to the table: ZRP will use its considerable contacts within the Polish underground in support of the uprising - as long as their position is secured, and they can act in open. Some consider the ZRP a dangerous outside actor we cannot control, but then again, they are fellow patriots."

 poland.550.t: "The OZN storms the Capital"
 poland.550.d: "Army units and militias loyal to Edward Rydz-Śmigły have mounted a surprise attack against the capital. Initially, few wanted to go against the famous general, who has become a symbol of the uprising during these past weeks - but when put against people's loyalty to National Democrats, he met his equal. Firefights broke out in the suburbs of Warsaw as the forces loyal to the National Government rallied against the power-grab. Surprisingly, a truce between the government forces and those loyal to Rydz-Śmigły was forged, and negotiations were opened.\n\nRydz-Śmigły had but one demand - to be appointed the Chief of State, invoking the tradition of Polish uprisings to grant one individual all power, both civilian and military, until the uprising is over. His demand is outrageous, but he is a larger than life figure to many Poles. Denying him would spark infighting among the rank and file, even if the general himself would no doubt accept it graciously for now. But on the other hand... people need their strong leaders, do they not?"
 poland.550.a: "Rydz will lead Poland to freedom!"
 poland.550.b: "This is an obvious power grab."

 poland.551.t: "The Dictator of the Revolution"
 poland.551.d: "It is a time-honoured tradition that in times of strife, power is concentrated on one man, who has the will and the skill to guide the nation through the crisis. Dictators of the people have led Polish uprisings time and again, and from that tradition Zakrzewski's supporters are inspired. One of his supporters, Jędrzej Moraczewski, held a strongly-worded speech in the Sejm today, demanding that power be transferred to a special Executive Committee under the control of Zakrzewski, with his centralisation of power granting him all he needs to lead the Polish people to final liberation.\n\nMany military leaders from the Citizen's Militia spoke in favour of Zakrzewski, arguing that from a military point of view, centralisation of power is mandatory. These suggestions were met with uproar from the anarchists and moderates, accusing Zakrzewski and the ZZZ of planning to form a dictatorship - but the opposition was weaker than was to be expected. Notably, a majority of those who had spent their years in France were rather silent. Perhaps they have understood what sacrifices the revolution demanded, something that their comrades who had lived under capitalist Poland could not understand?"
 poland.551.a: "Zakrzewski shall lead us!"
 poland.551.b: "That would debase our ideals!"
#
 poland.552.t: "The Death of Roman Dmowski"
 poland.552.d: "Today the father of Polish nationalism, Roman Dmowski, faded away, taken by poor health. He had spent his last twenty years in exile - in London, Paris and eventually Moscow. As a leader of the National Committee, he was effectively the leader of the Polish exiles in Russia, and his publications were widely read even in Poland, despite the best attempts of the government. Now that the grand old man who had essentially defined National Democracy's ideology for half a century has passed, the vultures are already circling.\n\nThe Council of the National League, the ruling body of the Endecja's political organisation in exile, is already trying to decide on a person who could be as unifying as Dmowski had been, with no avail. The worst divide in the movement has grown between so-called young and old guards. The old guard are prominently Christian Nationalists as Dmowski intended, while the young guard are more inspired by populist and violent methods of Boris Savinkov and the NRPR. Tadeusz Bielecki's bid for power was blocked by the young guard, as Dmowski's long-time secretary and right-hand man was seen as too conservative and moderate for the exiles. Jan Mosdorf, spokesman of the young guard, argued that as the international situation grows more dire, the National League needs bolder, more violent action, as opposed to the earlier underground activism.\n\nTo solve the conundrum, Adam Doboszyński presented himself as the middle ground. He is persona non grata in Poland - he left Poland some years ago after his raid on Myślenice made him forever infamous at home. He is somewhat of an outsider, with strong Christian Nationalist convictions, but many unorthodox ideas for a follower of Roman Dmowski. Despite that, he seems to be accepted by both the old and the young guard as a man who can lead the movement back to glory."
 poland.552.a: "He has large boots to fill."

 poland.555.t: "The Scythemen"
 poland.555.d: "So great is the lack of weapons among the revolutionary army, that some PPS-organised militia units have been only armed with war scythes, \"kosa bojowas\", in the tradition of numerous earlier uprisings starting from the army of Tadeusz Kościuszko. Such units are not involved in active combat, but they have been assigned to build fortifications and entrenchments around Warsaw and the city's immediate surroundings, to prepare for the worst.\n\nTheir propaganda value is easily greater than their military one, showing that Poles will defend their homeland, even without guns, if needed to. Units are to receive firearms as soon as ones become available."
 poland.555.a: "Well their spirit is admirable, at least."
#
 poland.561.t: "Economic Ties Severed!"
 poland.561.d.a: "The Polish economy was deeply intertwined to that of Germany, Galicia and other Central European countries. All that was ripped away, violently and without control, with the start of the uprising, with all ties cut to our neighbouring countries. We had not prepared for it adequately, and now the economy that should be supporting our desperate war is in tatters. Supply chains for our factories, relying on German steel and electronical parts, are broken, and coal from Silesia has stopped fuelling our furnaces. Our textile industry has no one to sell their surplus goods to, and the only buyer for all the surplus grain is the army, with their laughably low prices. Businesses are closed and tax income has dwindled.\n\nAt this rate, we have no money to pay for workers and soldiers... but we are sure that every Pole is willing to put aside their personal losses, when our independence is at stake."
 poland.561.d.b: "Wisely, the pre-war government had freed us of some of our dependency to Germany and the others, through their etatist policies. When all of our economic activity across our borders was cut short, the damage control softened the blow. Our industries dependant on German steel and coal were not stopped, but moved to use stockpiled resources. Our export industry had already been downscaled and re-focused towards internal consumption and production from local materials, so the hit is not as bad as it could have been.\n\nMake no mistake, the situation is still grim: Poland simply has no access to many resources that are needed for functioning modern economy, but we are not in risk of immediate budgetary collapse... for now."

 poland.562.d: "In the dark of the night, a group of loyalists and German agents broke into the Royal Palace, where the king had been placed in seclusion. The military police gave chase, but to no avail. The king's party managed to escape Warsaw in small groups, taking advantage of the chaotic state of our police force and the number of collaborators, who no doubt believe in German victory and wish to be rewarded in the future.\n\nA few days after the break-out, news came from the west that the former king had safely arrived to German side of the border via a small civilian aircraft, apparently hidden in the Polish countryside. It seems like the rescue operation was well-planned, and even better executed. Multiple law enforcement and intelligence officials in Warsaw were replaced for incompetence, but it did not help us to save face."

The king's party managed to escape Warsaw in small groups, taking advantage of the chaotic state of our police force and the number of collaborators, who no doubt believe in German victory and wish to be rewarded in the future.\n\nHowever, the luck of the German rescue party ran out in the countryside, as they stumbled into a patrol at night. The patrolling soldiers assumed the party to be German saboteurs, and opened fire after the demands for their surrender were not accepted. The Germans were outnumbered and outgunned, but fought bitterly trying to escape. Ultimately what was left of them were captured - and the Polish soldiers hardly believed that one of the badly wounded captives was none other but a disguised August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern himself. It is unclear if he was too badly wounded, or if the soldiers simply ignored tending to the hated King's wounds, but by the next morning, a telegram was received in Warsaw: the tyrant is dead."

Under PPS activist Maria Wittek, who had already been involved in Polish resistance activities during the last war, the Emilia Plater Independent Women's Battalion, named for from legendary Polish-Lithuanian 19th century heroine Emilia Plater, has been organised to support their countrymen in any way possible - including the frontlines, many of them insist.\n\nMany in our army leadership remain sceptical, fearing its effect on the morale and unit cohesion."

 poland.594.d: "Today a message has been delivered to us by way of the Polish embassy, with the dignitaries looking very serious as they delivered it. Upon further examination, it was an ultimatum: Warsaw demands the restitution of the lands of Cieszyn, which it claims is a vital part of its own history that was unlawfully ceded centuries ago, and now the time has come to reintegrate it within the fold; and should we refuse, Poland is ready to back this demand up by force of arms.\n\nA possible war hangs in the balance, over a piece of land that may not have been even that valuable to us in the first place.

More moderate socialists have pointed out that they supported our revolution, and even took up arms against our common enemy. And as France has shown us, the peasants are not incompatible to the syndicalist system.\n\nThe question stands, should we accept these revolutionaries of dubious loyalty or should their activities be banned until they have proved their loyalty to the new system?"

Even though the republic is hardly stable, many call for elections and a return to some semblance of normality, in fear that an extended state of emergency would make a return to democracy impossible.\n\nThe composition of the delegates gathered in the former Royal Palace represent the provisional Sejm, formed out of the trade union representatives and the leftist delegates of the parliament. Zakrzewski's supporters, informally the Zakrzewskites, represent the hardline revolutionaries, who are willing to compromise on liberal ideals, if it has to be done in the name of the revolution. Their opposition, the so-called left-syndicalists, are the second largest group, nominally loyal to Zakrzewski, but in constant disagreement over policy. The last major faction is the PPS-Lewica, which has come to include many members of the old moderate PPS as well. They are the most vocal advocates of moderation and of the parliamentary tradition."

A unitary democratic republic is, for them, already a well-functioning form of government.\n\nHowever, the trade unionists and some anarchists are violently opposed to such a \"surrender to status quo\", and argue that democracy can only be guaranteed through decentralisation, with each union and cooperative largely handling their own affairs.\n\nComrade Zakrzewski held a fiery speech declaring that only way to stop the revolution from falling to unelected bureaucrats is a radical, truly syndicalist form of state."

While almost everyone agrees that one man should never have complete power over the democratic system, there is a large bloc of ZZZ-aligned delegates and communists arguing for a strong president, elected through direct vote for 7-year term.\n\nTheir argument is simple - no socialist state has managed to survive its calamitous birth without initial tyranny and terror. When the revolution is struggling against both internal and external enemies, it must have strong leadership, one that can act fast and decisively."

The question is simple - should Zakrzewski give up his powers, and arrange elections as quickly as possible, or remain as the supreme leader?\n\nZakrzewski's supporters decry the entire question as an attempt to destabilise the revolution at a crucial moment, and as a stab-in-the-back by those who secretly hope to see the revolution collapse.

There have been claims of falsified votes, and the opposition has arranged large protests around the Sejm, but they did not dare to oppose Zakrzewski directly.

Volunteer militias are keeping the peace as different factions are attempting to convince the workers to their side.\n\nZakrzewski and his supporters are using populist rhetoric, building support from the disappointments of the poor, and promising national superiority. Their main opposition, a broad coalition of anti-Zakrzewski syndicalists and anarchists, are focusing their efforts to oppose Zakrzweski's cult of personality.

These positions have been stacked with \"true\" syndicalists, unwilling to compromise with the old bourgeois system.\n\nThe opposition, with the PPS at the helm, have been trying to mount a campaign of resistance, but it has not worked. Far too many are apathetic, and only focused on surviving to the next day in the middle of chaos of Poland, and some even silently welcome a strong centralised rule, if it means their daily bread and a safe border - and that is what the Wódz has promised them."

Much senseless bloodshed has stained the tiles of Polish churches, but the current anarchy is hardly to the revolution's advantage either.\n\nThe majority of the revolutionaries wish to push harsh secularisation and the total removal of the Church's temporal power, like in France some forty years ago. They argue that if the Church is allowed to even keep their organisation, they will become an organ of resistance inside the Workers' Republic, ready to collaborate with any future invaders.

Initially the beatings and intimidation worked, but when more and more people resisted the militias, the opposition grew ever bolder.\n\n The Robotnik, magazine of the Polish Socialist Party and the most widely read socialist magazine in the country, published a fiery piece declaring Kazimierz Zakrzewski a usurper, who has been unable to fulfil his promises of bread and safety. The text, written by the magazine's editor Zygmunt Zaremba, served as a rallying cry for the disunited opposition, and protests were organised. In a dramatic turn of events, a small group of militiamen broke into the Robotnik's publishing house and tried to arrest Zaremba. A quick shoot-out ensued, and three were wounded, with both sides blaming the other. Warsaw was near boiling point, as the red guards sided either with Zakrzewski or with Zaremba.\n\nIt was Zakrzewski who gave in first. In public, he explained that he would give up his emergency powers, as he promised, and let free elections commence. In his speech, he stressed how small people such as Poles cannot let disunity creep into their ranks, or their numerous enemies will swallow them. In the same announcement, he told of his plans to leave for Paris for an extended diplomatic mission there. It is not clear if it was his opposition that pressured him to leave Poland, or if he did it for his own security."

#Pre-revolution setup

 poland.630.t: "Whispers of a Revolution"
 poland.630.d: "In the aftermath of the election, discontent has only risen. The people are questioning the legitimacy of the government to continuously, and radical left-wing rhetoric is becoming increasingly widespread, despite attempts to crush it. In an emergency meeting of the Ministry of Interior, this growing instability was discussed at length, and two possible plans emerged.\n\nWith special legislation, a large-scale anti-socialist crackdown could be started. With enough arrests, the organisational ability of the revolutionary movement should be killed, before it can cause real problems. However, the plan does require cooperation from the Sejm and the judicial system, and might cause public backlash. The alternative is to merely observe the situation, and try to contain it without drawing too much attention. After all, people are rarely riled up forever."
 poland.630.a: "An Anti-Socialist crackdown, and now!"
 poland.630.b: "Merely observe the situation."

 poland.631.t: "The Union of Polish Syndicalists"
 poland.631.d: "The first step towards liberation of Poland was made in a clandestine meeting in suburban Kielce. The meeting was arranged by the ZZZ's chairman Kazimierz Zakrzewski, who had some weeks prior, smuggled himself to the Poland proper over the southern border. Alongside him there was number of other revolutionaries under false names, some of them having already fought in the French Civil War. These professional revolutionaries met with \"homegrown syndicalists\" of Congress Poland, such as the anarcho-syndicalist Pawel Lew Marek, and numerous representatives from radicalised unions and socialist organisations.\n\nDespite disagreements over what the ideal socialist system should be, an agreement was made to create a collective leadership and start organising for the revolution, which would start when the inevitable war between Germany and France begins. The fruits of these negotiations became the Union of Polish Syndicalists (ZSP)."
 poland.631.a: "To freedom!"

 poland.632.t: "The Vanguard of Freedom"
 poland.632.d: "The Union of Polish Syndicalists has been efficient. They quickly started to coordinate various underground printing houses through Revolutionary Press Agency to win over more support for their plot, especially with rumours that when the war comes, Poles will be sent to the trenches of the Western Front. Zakrzewski himself, under the pen-name \"Nostromo\", has been writing many of the articles, discussing matters of the earlier French and British revolutions and the improvement to common people's lives they brought, the treason of so-called Polish \"nationalists\" in defending Polish people, and the need for Polish patriots to cooperate with the syndicalist movement.\n\nAt the same time, weapons were produced and hidden, and clandestine \"hunting clubs\" started to give military training, just like Piłsudski's Riflemen's Association had done before the last war. Jerzy Szurig, under the codename \"Nader\", has been creating underground military wing for the ZSP. He himself fought in the Great War in French Foreign Legion, as part of the Legion of Bayonians, and is the trusted second-hand man to Zakrzewski. Under his organisation, French intelligence officers have been smuggled to the country, aiming to start building a radio network that would enable better coordination between the Internationale proper and the Polish underground. Careful moves were made towards the army, to distribute propaganda and identify possibly likeminded officers. Special care was put into the utilisation of Józef Piłsudski's memory, all with attempts to portray the current unrest as similar to pre-1914 situation, which many of the generals remembered well themselves. The board was being set for the last Polish uprising."
 poland.632.a: "We will make Piłsudski proud!"

 poland.633.t: "The Beginning of the People's War"
 poland.633.d: "The war between the Prussian tyrant and the free peoples of Europe has began. In the ZSP's various illegal publications, it has portrayed as struggle between oppressive empires and independent peoples, and there are open calls for any true patriotic Pole to oppose Kaiser Wilhelm's folly and any government that supports it.\n\nThe pacifist message has reached even the former political centre, as even the People's Party's organisations have joined syndicalist-led peace protests in some regions. With one hand, there is draft-dodging and anti-war leaflets, and with the other Wolność is training ever more partisans and smuggling weapons for them. There are plans to arranged a general strike alongside the PPS, while in secret, concrete plans for taking over the cities are being drafted by regional committees for liberation. News from the Western front is awaited with great interest, as every setback the Heer encounters brings the idea of free Poland a little more tangible."

 poland.650.d: "The dream between the seas has come true. The vast Eastern territories have been liberated by the Polish army, which has helped our Commonwealth brothers throw off their oppressors. In the founding session of the new Federal People's Assembly, delegates from Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and many other places gathered to lay the groundwork for the new state, one to hopefully fare better than the old Commonwealth.\n\nIssues arose quickly. While our socialist comrades are grateful for our aid, they are deeply suspicious of \"Polish imperialism\" and have pushed for vast concessions in the name of socialist fraternity. \"The Commonwealth of the Communes Between the Seas\" shall be composed of autonomous regions and special communes, each electing their representatives to the non-national assembly which handles common policy, such as military and foreign relations. In all else, the regional assemblies reign. Some of [POL.GetLeader]'s supporters have been outraged by this \"surrender\", but surprisingly, a majority of Polish socialists understand that a loose federation is the only way to secure the new state."
 poland.650.a: "The Partitions avenged!"

 poland.651.d: "There have been demands from our eastern comrades to move the capital out of the heart of Poland itself, and into the borderlands, into one of the old, multi-ethnic cities that best showcase our federation.\n\nThere is Vilnius, or Wilno or Vilnia, which served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and even the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for some time. Brest, or Bieraście or Brześć, where the Union of Brest was made in 1595 and later the Eastern European states were severed from Russia in the infamous treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The third choice is Lwów or Lviv, a city that has always been torn between the Polish and Ukrainian civilisations."

 poland.660.t: "The Union of the West Slavs"
 poland.660.d: "Czech Pan-slavist Karel Kramář was the first to imagine a union of West Slavs, to counterbalance Russia. In Poland, this concept of \"Zachodniasławia\" achieved some popularity in the left, it but never rose to the same level of prominence as Yugoslavia did for the Southern Slavs. However, after all the bloodshed of the war, the situation has emerged where Union of the West Slavs might happen after all.\n\nPolish arms have liberated our brothers in Czechia and Slovakia, and they are governed by revolutionary councils modelled after Poland. Under some pressure, the southern delegates have accepted to proclaim the Central European Confederation, a union between Poland, Czechia and Slovakia.\n\nThis Confederation follows decentralist syndicalist principles, and each third has more or less autonomy. France has sponsored the creation of this union greatly, as it will create a new, strong socialist power in the east, ready to stand against any potential enemies in the east."

 poland.700.t: "The Trial of Collaborationist Generals"
 poland.700.d: "In the past few decades of humiliation, many Poles lost their way and preferred to cooperate with the German occupiers, rather than proudly resist to the last. It is especially damning for the generals, men ostensibly sworn to defend the nation of Poland. But no! Those oathbreakers licked German boots and forgot their true loyalties. They have grown fat on the back of ordinary Poles, feasting in banquets with the hated Heer officers and Ruhr slave-owners. Even many of those who have not fraternised with the Germans are guilty of scheming and abusing their positions, seeing their career merely as means to achieve more power.\n\nBut finally the judgement is here, as men loyal to the national uprising are rounding up the collaborators, ready to sentence them for their crimes against the fatherland."

 poland.701.d: "The new Sejm is primarily composed of Endek delegates, and those like-minded with the nationalist cause. However, they are anything but loyal to Adam Doboszyński. Even those who had followed Roman Dmowski blindly to the exile are hesitant. Doboszyński is denounced as a radical outsider by many, a man who is more of a terrorist than a leader for respectable country. These \"Old Dmowskites\" are in unison with more parliamentarian-minded delegates, and only quite a small minority of the Sejm actually sits behind the leader.\n\nIf we are to maintain sovereign rule, these weak-willed opponents of the future must be either removed, or convinced of the error of their ways."

 poland.702.d: "No one collaborated with the Germans as much as the Masonic-Jewish elite: the magnates living in luxury in their estates, the industrialists preferring the company of Germans to their workers. They ignored their consciences, and turned their fellow countrymen into machines serving their eternal lust for gold and coal.\n\nTheir stupidity made the common man susceptible to even worse delusions like Godless socialist agitation, when they should have been fostering Polish unity and welfare. Finally they will be punished for their deeds."

 poland.703.t: "The Second Trial of Adam Doboszyński"
 poland.703.d: "The plot had been brewing for quite some time. Much of the pre-existing political establishment hated Adam Doboszyński and saw him as a dangerous radical, whose promises of radical property distribution and removing the elites from power were seen as a threat. In the military, Doboszyński was mistrusted and his grandiose schemes for conquests were seen as potentially dangerous military adventurism. The combination gave the putschists all they needed to oust the president.\n\nAs Doboszyński was addressing the Sejm, the schemers started their plan and locked down the building. It only took a handful of military police, those tasked with the security of the parliament. After the lockdown, the charges were laid at Doboszyński's feet - murder and imprisonment of political opposition, unconstitutional power-grabs and numerous other violations, both real and imagined. He answered to the accusations as calmly as he could, and even cornered, he showed remarkable control of the situation. For a moment the putschists were worried that the accused would talk the Sejm to his side, but when his impeachment was voted, the more conservative line triumphed.\n\nOnce stripped of his power, Doboszyński was escorted outside until his fate could be decided."
 poland.703.a: "The man was crazy."

 poland.704.t: "The Monoidea"
 poland.704.d: "The concept of multiparty democracy is inherently flawed. Any decision worth making should be done with a large majority, or it is merely a dictatorship of the 51%. Thus the first step in Adam Doboszyński's new National Political System is the creation of a new political organisation that will eventually replace political parties. This new discussion forum for the country's leaders and common men alike would serve to foster unanimity - the monoidea - among the Polish people, and hopefully heal the scars that decades of party politics have slashed into the unity of the nation.\n\nIn Doboszyński's vision, this new political organisation will educate and guide the nation's political culture until the common people are politically mature enough to take part in political life properly. It will also serve as the organisation for the corporations - understood in a Catholic sense, as associations of related persons - to coordinate economic life. With multiparty discord swept away from Polish politics, the brightest minds of the nation can focus on improving the prosperity of Poland as a whole."
 poland.704.a: "Why did no one think of this before?"

 poland.705.t: "Three Acres and a Cow"
 poland.705.d: "The basic principle of distributism is that all activity should be done in the smallest possible unit, such as a family business instead of joint-stock company, or a family farm instead of a large mechanised farm. While it might not be as efficient, such things are not priorities for distributionists like Adam Doboszyński. Instead, the aim of the ideology is to ensure that wealth is distributed as evenly as possible, so that everyone would have what they need, and small number of individuals could not rob a major part of the natural resources for themselves. Essentially what is needed is reform of ownership.\n\nFocusing on land ownership first, it is imperative that every Polish family who so wishes will have their own plot of land - \"three acres and a cow\", as the ideological father of distributism, GK Chesterton said. This land will be taken from the domains of the magnates, starting from German and Jewish elites as their share of the wealth is disproportionally higher than that of the Poles. While they own very large estates, it is doubtful that it is enough to give everyone plots large enough to sustain their families. However, going after the Polish landowners - who have thus far been supporters of the National Democrat ideas - might make them reconsider their allegiance to Doboszyński."
 poland.705.a: "Confiscate the German and Jewish-owned land, but leave the Polish magnates at peace."
 poland.705.b: "Even Poles can oppress another Pole. The magnates will give their share!"

 poland.706.t: "An Olive Branch to the People's Party"
 poland.706.d: "Whether we like it or not, the People's Party has the right idea. Poland is inherently a peasant nation. Its peasant party has merely been hijacked by liberal intelligentsia and Freemasonry, who have turned Polish peasants into their tool. The Doboszyński Programme should be easy to sell to their average rank-and-file, as long as their corrupt leaders are swept away.\n\nHowever, they have been a thorn in National Democracy's side for as long as we can remember, and it is possible that they are mere false peasants, who have no love for Polish nation, not truly. After all, they have been quick to work with the socialists at every turn. Should we try to turn them into part of our organisation, or just convert the cream of the crop?"
 poland.706.a: "Hijack their entire party organisation."

 POL_hijack_psl_tt: "Convert §lSocial Liberal§! popularity into §NNational Populist§! popularity."

 poland.707.t: "The Jewish-German Emigration"
 poland.707.d: "The Jewish Question has been a thorny one among the Polish right. Many radicals have called for total deportation of Jews from Poland, as they are seen as a foreign element, one that does not fit the inherent Catholicism of Poland. However, as the Jews form almost ten percent of the population, this is hardly practical.\n\nAdam Doboszyński's stance is rather pragmatic. While he has no love for the Jews among the Poles, he believes that Jews should form a nation of their own somewhere, and live in peace there - just like Poles are meant to live in one nation, Ukrainians in another and so on. To this goal, campaigns have been started to encourage the foreign elements - Jews, Germans, Ukrainians - to emigrate away from Poland.\n\nThe process was already started during the uprising, when much Jewish or German property was stolen, destroyed or nationalised, leaving thousands without their means of living. The police and the judicial system have a long tradition of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic crime, and it has only increased ever since the National Democrats rose to power."
 poland.707.a: "Alright."

 poland.708.t: "The Tyranny of Industry"
 poland.708.d: "Is there nothing more immoral than a Christian forcing their fellow Christian to waste away in a factory or a mine, doing dangerous and repetitive work that is completely unnatural for a human being? All the great social issues of the 20th century - socialism, poverty, immorality and secularism - are products of the Industrial Revolution. And like the French one before it, this revolution has only brought misery to the common man. Man does not need factory-made shoes for a good life. In fact, humanity has survived well without, and should continue to do so.\n\nWhile some sectors of industry are unarguably needed, like energy production and infrastructure, the vast majority of production should be decentralised into smaller units. Family businesses and craftsmen workshops are the ideal units of production - anything larger leads to the misery of its workers and the moral corruption of its owner."

 poland.708.b: "Form worker's cooperatives from factories!"

 poland.709.t: "The Dream of Union"
 poland.709.d: "The West Slavs form a natural group of peoples with shared interests. Lodged between grand imperialistic powers, their very existence depends on their cooperation. And by this definition, the West Slavs are not just the Poles, Czechs and Slovakians. No, they are the entire cultural region between German and Russian pressure, which includes Poland's natural ally, Lithuania, and even Ukraine and Belarus, whose very national identity has been under threat of destruction by the Russians.\n\nUnder no circumstance can Russia be counted among the Slavic states - they are a bastardisation of Slavs and Byzantophile petty princes whose culture is closer to that of the Mongols, and other Turanic steppe peoples, than ancient centres of culture such as Kraków or Prague.\n\nWhile being allies with one of the partitioning powers might be necessary in short term, as long as they exist, the West Slavic sphere can never prosper."

 poland.730.t: "Catastrophe in Russia"
 poland.730.d: "The unthinkable has happened. Russia, which has beaten the communist tide once already, has fallen, and Moscow is now in socialist hands. Many white emigres have escaped the country to Eastern Europe, including Poland. Several of these aristocrats and officers were granted asylum, thanks to their contacts in the Polish nobility. The leadership of the National League, including Roman Dmowski, have reportedly fled to Romania, as they are not welcome in Poland.\n\n\"The greatest geopolitical disaster since 1925\" has in one blow shattered the hopes of the radical National Democrats of liberating Poland, in cooperation with the Russians. Two camps have emerged - some of the diehard activists still believe that Poland can become free through their own efforts, and the large majority of the right who are increasingly accepting the status quo as the best possible situation. Germany might be an enemy, they argue, but the current monarchy is a minor cost if it protects Poland from the murderous tide of socialism that would eradicate Polish faith and national identity.\n\nThe clash in his movement has left the old man Dmowski less and less interested in active politics, as younger men are debating about the correct stance to take."

 poland.731.d: "After socialists took power in Russia, many of their political opponents fled the country. We have received a share of the exiles, but the most important out of them is the leadership of the Polish National League, a nationalist organisation seeking to overthrow the current regime in Poland and replace it with a nationalist one.\n\nThe Conducator arranged the asylum swiftly, and the Poles have established themselves in Bucharest under leadership of Adam Doboszyński. These Poles are in many ways ideological colleagues of the Legion, though this is exactly why King Carol II has been wary to welcome them. However, they could provide a useful tool against the Habsburg Empire, as the National Democrats enjoy many contacts with the Galician Poles, and could no doubt help us in destabilising the Habsburg realm further."

Rumours of his intent to stand down and abdicate in favour of his son have been frequent in the past few years, and it seems that they were grounded in real plans. The royal family has been silently testing the ice in seeing whether or not Alexander would be seen more favourably than his father. After his marriage and highly publicised career in the Polish army, it is fair to say that the Crown Prince is far more popular than his father has ever been.\n\nThe kingdom is on relatively safe ground, and personally the king would gladly step aside, and focus on his artistic and cultural hobbies."

The Polish Army, together with their allies, refused to surrender and bitterly fought on. [?casualties] Poles lay dead in heroes' graves, and have bought the admiration and trust of the Germans with their blood. Against all odds, the liberator and the Hohenzollern in Berlin today is [POL.GetLeader]. The city is still in ruins after being fought in twice, but its centre has been restored enough to make it presentable for the parade, which newly-reinstated Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] is receiving alongside the man whom he owes his crown, [POL.GetLeader]. To honour the Polish sacrifices, the units of First Polish Armoured Division, the Black Devils, are to roll under the Brandenburg Gate as the first soldiers of the parade.\n\nIt is not clear if it was the king's idea, or merely his Polish advisors', but the question of Posen was raised in private negotiations with the Germans. The region was de facto controlled by Poland for months during the war, and many Poles from the region fought under the white-red flag. The temporary German government begrudgingly accepted to \"let the people of Posen decide which country they wish to belong.\" Such a move would have been impossible to imagine just a few years ago, but in the current situation it does not seem possible to deny. The Kingdom of Poland is not only free, but also the liberator of the entire Kaiserreich."

 polandflavor.1.d: "The King and his family have taken a holiday in his forest retreat, leaving Warsaw for a more peaceful corner of the country. He had a small mansion built for himself and his family some years ago, near the idyllic village of Załucze Stare in south-eastern Poland. It is well-known how the King has no enthusiasm for most matters of state, and his absence will not cause many issues to the every-day running of government.\n\nDespite August's distant relations with Queen Alexandra, the pair seemed happy to be able to distance themselves from court life for some time. The Royal Family is expected to stay in Załucze Stare for a week, a time in which both August and Alexandra are expected to be immersed in their shared artistic hobbies such as the painting of flower arrangements."

 polandflavor.2.d: "Young and handsome - and most importantly, unmarried - Prince Alexander has had his fair share of admirers, but thus far he has expressed his disinterest in marrying, preferring to focus on his career in the Polish Air Force instead. There has been some pressure for the 26 year old prince to find a suitably high match in fears that without heir, King August's legitimacy would suffer.\n\nThese fears were proven empty when a sensational magazine published rumours of Prince Alexander's secret relationship with a commoner, Wanda Zawacka. She is a Pole of common birth, and her family has been involved in independence activism in the past. The relationship has been blooming for months now, and when approached by his father, Alexander was defiant, and expressed his wish to marry Zawacka, despite the dynastic and political scandal it would cause. Kaiser Wilhelm II has privately expressed his wish with August to persuade his son to abandon such folly, for the sake of dignity of the House Hohenzollern."

 polandflavor.3.d: "The young prince has not give up on his love, despite both his father and his grandfather very clearly forbidding Prince Alexander's morganatic marriage. Despite hours of trying to change his mind, no one has managed to talk Alexander away from his plans of marrying Miss Zawacka. The King has all but given up on the prince, seeing any effort to change Alexander's mind on the issue as futile. When the prince announced the wedding that would take place in a small chapel in Warsaw, the last hopes of restraining the rebellious prince were in vain. There were no Hohenzollerns in the ceremony - the Kaiser had explicitly forbidden any member of the dynasty to join Alexander. Only a small group of the pair's personal friends were present as they were wed.\n\nFor his clear disobedience of both his father and the head of the Hohenzollern family, in addition to breaking the dynastic laws against morganatic marriage, Crown Prince Alexander was told to abdicate from his position as the Crown Prince and the Heir to the Throne of Poland - which he promptly gave up, declaring that he did not desire the throne in the first place. His disinheritance leaves the succession of the Kingdom in disarray, as August has no other children. It is widely assumed that he will name his younger brother, Prince Oskar, as his heir."

 polandflavor.4.t: "Alexander's Marriage"
 polandflavor.4.d: "It was clear that Prince Alexander could not be swayed on his marriage plans. Seeing this, his parents decided it best to let Alexander follow his love, and ignore pleas from the head of the family. The royal family came to an agreement that Alexander will step aside from the succession and the King's younger brother, Oskar, would be nominated as heir. Alexander could then marry freely whomever he wished - and a wedding with Miss Zawacka was quickly arranged. It was a small scale celebration with only a small number of family and friends present.\n\nDespite the low profile, the event has gathered enormous media coverage in the Polish press, not the least because of Wanda Zawacka's humble birth. Ironically the prince became immensely more popular in Poland after relinquishing his titles than he ever was as the Crown Prince, and it seems that the King's decision to allow it is widely respected among his subjects."

 polandflavor.5.t: "Alexander's Marriage"
 polandflavor.5.d: "It seems that Prince Alexander's earlier romance was just a fling. Like a responsible heir to the throne, he left Miss Zawacka and focused on his career instead. In a twist of fate, he met a young Polish noblewoman from Poznań during his father's 52nd birthday celebrations. This Maria Zofia Bnińska was of an old and prestigious Polish family from Prussia. Whether out of actual love, or simply some attraction and a sense of duty, the pair ended up together - to the great relief of the court and the royal family.\n\nAlmost everyone seems happy about the news - the Poles respect that the Crown Prince chose his bride from an old Polish family, and Germans are happy for the symbolic significance of a spouse from Poznań. As for the Prince and the Princess themselves, only time can tell if their marriage will be a happy one."

His promotion to First Lieutenant and his command of the 14th Reconnaissance Escadrille stationed in Łódź have gathered a decent amount of media coverage. There were even aerial acrobatics shows arranged to celebrate the occasion - and show off the Royal Polish Air Force at the same time. The prince himself was among the 14 pilots who danced over the skies of Łódź in their PZL.50 Jastrząbs.\n\nSuch celebrations are a good way to increase both the popularity of the military and the monarchy - and it seems to have worked, as the crown prince keeps on being the darling of the media."

As a student of aircraft engineering, she already had a career in aviation before the war, and is now organising the recruitment of pilots and engineers from Warsaw Polytechnic.\n\nShe also fully intends to flight combat aircraft, saying that she has no reason to give less for her fatherland than her mother had done, who had served in the Polish Legions in communications."

 polandflavor.10.d: "Originally created as an association of former soldiers of the Polish Legions, and later close associates of Józef Piłsudski in 1918, the Związek Legionistów Polskich (as it is in Polish) has served since then as a \"legal\" combatant organisation in the Kingdom of Poland. While on paper this organisation's purpose was to memorialise the Legion's accomplishments and help its former members, in reality it was one of powerbases of Piłsudski's organisations, serving also as a link between him and the republican underground, while he was in house arrest.\n\nNow that the old commandant has passed away, and the freshly chosen Edward Rydz-Śmigły has resigned from leadership of the ZLP, the election of a new leader was necessary, though it was a hard task, as Piłsudski's followers were divided since his death.\n\nThree men are considered as possibilities: Adam Koc, protégé of the new commandant, who might open more cracks in already broken camp, Kazimierz Sosnkowski, an old friend of Piłsudski, even considered by some as his natural heir, who might mend the rift caused by Rydz's leadership, and Aleksander Prystor, a long-time colleague of old commandant, who has been lately cooperating with the PPS."

They cut the telephone lines and took control of the police depot under the cover of darkness - and then turned towards their real goal, the sizable Jewish settlement. Jewish shops were raided and plundered, and their entire inventories burned in the town square. Even the synagogue was set on fire, and the militiamen beat the Jews who tried to oppose them.\n\nThey were acting under the orders of Adam Doboszyński, a National Democracy activist of merely 22 years of age. The \"Raid of Myślenice\" would make him into a hero of the Polish far-right, a man who was not afraid to do what he considered right. After ransacking through the Jewish properties, Doboszyński's men fled to a nearby forest, leaving a burning and scarred Myślenice behind them.\n\nMultiple police units were dispatched immediately, and clashed with the raiders multiple times during the days-long ride towards the Bohemian border. Most of them did not make it, and one particularly harsh fight with the Galician cavalry cracked Doboszyński's troops, and over half of them were arrested. Doboszyński himself was involved in a shootout with Hungarian border guards, but escaped nonetheless."

 polandflavor.12.t: "The Trials of Adam Doboszyński"
 polandflavor.12.d: "Perhaps the most awaited trial in both Polands began early today, as the man named Adam Doboszyński was brought before the courthouse of Kraków. A radical nationalist activist of OWP of just 22 years of age, Doboszyński had built himself a budding cult of personality in the Polish far-right. His calm demeanour betrayed the fiery oratory of his speeches and pamphlets, shared widely by Polish nationalist circles. He declared himself to be a follower of the Third Way, children of the age betrayed by both Capitalism and Socialism. He preached for the Great Nation and for the purification of its soul with Christian principles of morality and goodness of the human nature.\n\nAnd today, he admitted all of his guilt. Yes, he was the one responsible for the raid on Myślenice. Yes, he had organised the group of militia and attacked the Jews. And in what had quickly made him legendary, he had given himself up to the police after only few days of hiding. His actions were not an anarchist coup, Doboszyński argued, but rather simply a political demonstration. Whether due to his actual popular support, or from fear of the far-right, the jury acquitted Doboszyński of all charges, stating that he had acted under conditions of \"higher necessity\".\n\nDoboszyński's freedom did not last. The ruling was overturned by the Appellate Tribunal in Lemberg. This second hearing in Imperial court found Doboszyński guilty of instigating an armed attack against the police, organising an insurrection, illegal possession of firearms and unlawful destruction of property. Rather than sentencing Doboszyński to decades of imprisonment, the judges gave in to the ever-growing sympathetic crowds demanding Doboszyński's freedom. In the end, he was tried for merely one crime - illegal handling of firearms."

#Rydz-Śmigły founds OZN
 polandflavor.13.t: "The Camp of National Unity"
 polandflavor.13.d: "In a radio address today, Colonel Adam Koc announced the creation of the Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego - OZN, Camp of National Unity. The party is mostly formed out of conservative politicians, thinkers and veterans. The manifesto is centred on General Rydz-Śmigły, who has acted as the heir to Piłsudski's legacy.\n\nThe OZN has declared their intent to support Rydz-Śmigły's campaign to strengthen and militarize Poland to weather the coming storms. The platform is essentially copied from the National Democrats, featuring anti-Semitic rhetoric of purification of Poland from \"foreign elements\", and veneration of traditional Christian values."

#Zaleski's propaganda
 polandflavor.14.t: "Polska bez Proletaryatu"
 polandflavor.14.d: "It is rare for book releases to become matters of national security, but Wojciech Zaleski's work \"Polska bez Proletaryatu\" has raised many eyebrows around the country. Zaleski - co-founder of the radical and ultranationalist ONR - is a rising star among the right, second to only Adam Doboszyński himself.\n\nThe gospel Zaleski is preaching is not pleasant for the supporters of the Kingdom - as it calls for tearing down the corrupt system and building it anew, something that is neither capitalist nor syndicalist, but an entirely Polish idea. In ONR's ideal Poland, the nation would be ruled along the lines of Catholic morals - without Jews, liberalism, or the troubles of capitalist robber barons or socialist depravity. We have banned the sale of his books, but there are plenty of underground prints - and smuggling from the south - that gladly spread the nationalist pedagoguery to our Kingdom."

 polandflavor.15.d: "The police raided ONR's main offices in Kalisz after group of ONR-connected activists were accused of the murder of a Jewish man a week ago. There have been constant calls by the councillors to shut the National Radical Camp down, and this raid might provide us with the evidence to finally gain solid legal ground for its banning. Unfortunately the raid escalated, as group of ONR members were caught armed. In a turn of events that are more fitting to Romanian Legion than for civilised state of Poland, the police ended up in fire-fight against the radicals holed up in their base.\n\nThe militiamen were armed with rifles and home-made bombs, and managed to hold on until the police reinforcements arrived. Multiple OZN members were wounded in the fight, the most well-known of them being Wojciech Zaleski, who was wounded in the crossfire. Despite the best attempts of the doctors to save him, Zaleski died of his wounds. Even if the incident has given us the perfect reason to ban the organisation, the nationalists have found a new martyr."

 polandflavor.16.t: "A Polish Saint"
 polandflavor.16.d: "In a declaration from Pope [PAP.GetLeader], 17th century Polish priest Andrzej Bobola has been officially canonised as a saint. Bobola, who is often called \"The Apostle of Polesia\" has already been the unofficial patron saint of Poland. He was a Jesuit missionary who worked tirelessly in the Pinsk and Polesia regions at spreading Catholicism in Ruthenia. Bobola was captured, tortured and murdered by a group of Zaporozhian Cossacks during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1657. After his exceedingly brutal death, he was buried in Pinsk, and after his death, many Poles have claimed to have seen the martyr in visions promising that one day Poland will be resurrected. Bobola's body was reportedly unspoiled and mummified, which was seen as further proof of his holiness. \n\nNow he has been finally brought back to Poland, to the Church of Our Lady of Grace in the old town of Warsaw. The faithful revere the recognition of Polish martyrhood by the Vatican as a strong symbol for Polish independence."

 polandflavor.17.t: "Achtung Panzer!"
 polandflavor.17.d: "Fresh off the press and already in circulation amongst prominent military circles, is \"Achtung-Panzer!\", a book on a new form of warfare, written by Heinz Guderian.\n\nGuderian, a prominent officer in the Kaiser's army, has been in Poland for the last few years as a military attaché to the Polish King's forces, although some speculate the Prussian is here purely due to disagreements with the German army command. Radical in its conception, the book has attracted controversy among conservative military theorists and those who believe Guderian's theory will dominate the future of warfare. Indeed, the Polish military has already embraced Guderian's ideas to create their very own armoured division, with Guderian supervising its development and their exercises in the field.\n\nThe book focuses on the increased motorisation of the armed forces, embracing the concentrated use of tanks while also adopting the union of aerial and land coordination by infantry and close air support. Guderian argues against the use of cavalry (due to the effectiveness of the machine gun) and instead pushes for modern cavalry to be one of mechanised infantry. Furthermore, Guderian focuses on the bitter attrition that plagued the Weltkrieg, and offers the further adoption and integration of tanks in the armed forces to break through the stalemate of attrition. Guderian analyses the armoured forces of his own country, but he also surveys the tank programmes of Russia, the Commune of France, and the Union of Britain - listing their strengths as well as their shortcomings. As tensions flare across the European continent once more, and the threat of a second Weltkrieg more is possible by the day - many wonder if Guderian's theory will have a chance to prove itself. "

 polandflavor.18.t: "\"Facing the Oncoming Second World War\",\nby Władysław Studnicki"
 polandflavor.18.d: "Władysław Studnicki is a very divisive figure, as a founding father of the modern Polish state, but also the main figure rationalising the pro-German tendency of Polish politics after 1914. In Studnicki's many literary works and long tenure as a senator, he has always called for cooperation with Germany against the Russian menace. In his latest book, \"Facing the Oncoming Second World War\", his outlook is grim.\n\nHe argues that the Central European hegemony, established by Germany, will be challenged by both the rising Russian expansionism and the Judeo-Syndicalist states of the west. On the brink of war, there must be no discord in the alliance of \"civilised peoples\", or Russia will destroy the Polish nation again, this time completely. In Studnicki's mind, Central Europe can form a superpower of 200 million people, with Germany and Poland as its driving core, able to stand against the foreign powers who would seek to subjugate them."

 polandflavor.19.t: "The Art of Poland"
 polandflavor.19.d: "After the Great War, a deeply traumatised generation poured themselves into new styles of art. Old Romanticism-influenced movements became obsolete in the world where millions upon millions of young men had died in seemingly pointless bloodshed. Even in Germany, where government officials were often restrictive towards avant-garde styles, the new \"modernism\" bloomed. To modernists, like the Neues Bauen movement in Germany, the Brutalists in France and the Polish Constructivism, what is wanted is a world of steel and glass, mass-produced and functional. The bold modernism of people like Władysław Strzemiński and Tamara Łempicka has been divisive and often portrayed as very left-wing, and not without reason. Many avant-garde artists are critical towards the monarchy and \"the Old Order\", which they see as uncreative and stuck in the past.\n\nWhen talking of art in Poland, one cannot ignore the royal couple's artistic style. Ironically, August is allied with the neo-romanticist and folk artists in Poland, who seek to strengthen Polish national identity with art themes stemming from Poland's history and its countryside. August's latest works are influenced much by Symbolism and even Völkisch ideas of art portraying pure, untainted and natural subjects. The king's most recent work is \"Dawn in Jeleniowska\", a quite simple landscape piece portraying the Świętokrzyskie mountains. It is seen as conservative and bland by many famous artists, though the reception has been better on the right."

 polandflavor.22.t: "The Last of the Swords"
 polandflavor.22.d: "Everyone knows a dashing officers' or noblemans' full attire requires a proper sword - and there is no better sword than the Ludwikówka, many Poles would say. Technically known as szabla wz. 34, this truly modern cavalry sabre is the product of the brightest minds and smiths in Poland. Having been described as \"the perfect weapon, well-balanced and uncommonly too easy to cut with\", every produced szabla wz. 34 has to be able to pierce 2 millimetres of steel sheet, and cut multiple steel bars of 5 mm diameter, without damaging the blade.\n\nThese swords have become very fashionable among Prussian aristocracy, having spread from the Polish court and military. The demand for the Ludwikówkas has boomed, both because of the fashion, and because of the major expansion the Polish Army done in the last year. Orders have increased to the extent that it is now planned to increase the production of these swords. It must be done carefully, however, as any drop in quality would be a sad fate."

 polandflavor.23.d: "Thanks to our mole inside a Polish-Ukrainian smuggling network, the Lublin police managed to successfully intercept a major drugs shipment before it could be transported further east. This so called \"Great Eastern Route\" runs straight through Poland, taking advantage of the relaxed borders customs inside Mitteleuropa, and the difficulty for the police of different countries to cooperate. The drugs are brought en masse to Germany and then smuggled further east, through Warsaw, Lublin and then to Ukraine and finally into Russia, where the greatest profits are made.\n\nThese kind of incidents have only grown in frequency these past few decades. The Weltkrieg left thousands of veterans addicted to substances such as morphine, ether and cocaine, gifts of the German chemical industry. Even though we are now more aware of the serious addiction threat posed by these drugs, their usage has only grown. No more reduced to veterans, especially ether, and its derivative \"Hoffman's drops\", they have turned out to be popular recreational drugs, used by people from high society to the poor workers. This makes the problem hard to solve - many of the criminals are wealthy people owning their own warehouses, buying cheap drugs from Germany and selling them further east."

 polandflavor.24.d: "The eight edition of the famed \"Polish Code of Honour\" by Captain Władysław Boziewicz has been published. In it, the author is trying to modernise many aspects of the traditional of duelling. Technically the practice is illegal, but that has not stopped duelling remaining popular, particularly among Polish and Prussian officers and students, especially due to men like Józef Piłsudski and Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski being known for their penchant for duelling.\n\nIn his Code of Honour, Boziewicz has formulated the rules for honourable duelling, the differing degrees of insults to be used, and other general guidelines for honourable behaviour. As part of modernising the rules, he has widened the definition of a \"gentleman\" from just the nobility, to any person of high education or important social function. A peasant who holds a seat in the Sejm is thus considered just as honourable as a nobleman. He is also clear in his straight prohibition for duelling with the intent to kill, and makes many other guidelines in increasing the safety of the otherwise risky pastime."

In an address given by Crown Prince Alexander, he was posthumously awarded the state decoration of the Order of the White Eagle. Despite his criticism towards Piłsudski, both the men of the King and the dissenters can agree that the general was a nationalist who did the best he could for the nation.\n\nNow the General staff has a void needing a new appointment.

The man was quick to introduce himself to the local newspapers as none other than Paweł Salwator Piast-Riedelski, self-proclaimed Duke of Poland and Odobrites, and claimant to the throne of Poland. There were some residents who welcomed and cheered for him, with some even saying that he should be their King instead of some foreign \"Szkop\".\n\nThe duke even claimed to be recognised by the Austrians as legitimate ruler in 1908, and declared that he will stay in Warsaw's top hotel and wait for his crown. He has also announced the creation of many aide-funds to help neighbouring rural areas with their poverty and other problems, \"as a good King should do\"."

Duke Paweł Salwator Piast-Riedelski is now claiming to be a descendant of the medieval King Bolesław II the Bold. Initially there was some excitement around the claimant, mainly because of his generous aid programmes and funding of many children's organisations. The high society of Warsaw has been especially interested in him, to the great annoyance of the royal government.\n\nFortunately his sham did not run for very long. It started with an affair concerning his aid fund, which all turned out to be an elaborate scheme, where all the donations went to the extravagantly-living Duke himself. Even his claims about his birth were not true - he turned out to be born in Germany. Furious mobs devastated his aid centres, and the self-proclaimed King had to flee Poland."

 polandflavor.30.d: "After his initial stay there, the former King of Poland, August Wilhelm, found that being part of the Hohenzollern dynasty in occupied Germany brought him little favour. Discreetly, he and his family petitioned the Polish government for asylum and were granted it, as they still were Polish citizens - on the condition that they lay low and stay out of politics. The family bought a small estate near the city of Danzig, and started their life as common citizens. Both August and Alexandra now are artists and sell their work, while Alexander works as an aviation engineer.\n\nThe Hohenzollerns are from time to time interviewed by the media, curious about the irony of the former royal family now living normal life as Polish Germans. The former king has mostly refrained from public comments, though it is rumoured that he has his memoirs in the works. It remains to be seen what kind of image these memoirs will paint of him, but the popular perception in Poland has turned strangely positive after the revolution and the war: him stepping down peacefully is even seen as noble, despite all the fiery words against August while he was still on the throne."

To celebrate this grand reunion, many ceremonies are being held along the coasts under our control, where the Polish nation is symbolically reunited with the sea.\n\nOn a more practical level, access to the Baltic Sea opens us a supply route - a slim and unsure one, but a route nonetheless.

After 1920, it has hosted even more tyrannical occupant, King August IV himself. But now the kings are gone, as the country has thrown off the shackles of oppression, and the Castle sits as a blight upon the worker's paradise that is Warsaw. Its central place and prestigious status would serve some government office well, but some would prefer to use the castle as a museum instead, to wholly forget it's use to rule over men."

 polandflavor.33.d: "The great Modlin Fortress, some fifty kilometres north of Warsaw, has been one of Europe's greatest defensive structures for a century now. It was modernised and expanded greatly during Russian rule, when it was known as Novogeorgievsk, the symbol of Russian might looming over Warsaw like barrel of a gun. The Germans captured the fortress complex with almost no fighting in 1915, and after briefly serving as barracks, it was left to become obsolete, as further fortifications were focused to the east, not north.\n\nHowever, the fortress is perfectly suited to renovation. While fixed fortifications do not serve as impregnable walls as they did in the past, sufficiently armed fortress can still cover Warsaw's northern flank and delay the enemy greatly. General Major Zbigniew Antonowicz has put forward a plan to modernise the bunkers of the Modlin Fortress and install modern anti-air and anti-tank emplacements."

 polandflavor.34.d: "When asked why the great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fell to ruin, Roman Dmowski pointed to how multiculturalism was what made the Commonwealth weak. From the Endecja's point of view, they would rather look back to the medieval Kingdom of Poland, ruled by the Piast dynasty. To them, by expanding outside natural Polish borders, the nation became weak and disunited. Jews, Germans, Ukrainians and Russians robbed Poland of its identity, and only a homogenous Poland can survive against its many foes. And the concept is not confined to the Endeks - it has even enjoyed tacit support from the modern Kingdom of Poland, which is painted as \"Piast Poland reborn\" by its supporters.\n\nThis is contrasted to the Jagiellon Concept, popularised the most by Józef Piłsudski, and still supported mostly in the far-left and by some other radicals. This envisions Poland as a multi-ethnic federation, and points the reason of the Commonwealth's failure as instead being due to dysfunctional rule by its nobles. To the Jagiellonists, it is Poland's very purpose to civilise and protect the poor eastern lands, and that it cannot let nationalist squabbles cause further division. The idea does not enjoy much support among the Kingdom's intellectuals, who see the entire concept as mere fantasy."

Only a minority of them are large landholders who wield considerable political influence in the Geheimrat. The vast majority of Polish Germans have had a long history of cooperation with Polish and Jewish organisations, and are generally members of the German Labour Party of Poland (DAP), a moderate socialist party with close connections to both the German and the Polish social democratic parties. They tend to de-emphasise issues of nationality, and usually work together with the PPS as a small allied party in the Sejm. "

After the declaration, the Provisional Council of State was created to organise the public life of new-born Poland, with Józef Piłsudski leading the military arm. As one of the Central Powers, Poland fought for its liberty from the Russian Empire.\n\nThe initial choice of 5th of November as the national day was controversial, as it focuses on how the Kingdom of Poland exists because Germany and Austria allowed it to, but as the years have gone by, the day has been changed into an actual national celebration, that tries to focus on Poland's struggle for liberty against Russia, and commemorates the earlier anti-Russian uprisings."

Since Black Monday hit Poland, they have started surging in popularity with their populist anti-capitalist and anti-monarchist rhetoric.\n\nIn Dagnan's manifesto, he declares his party to be a continuation of the \"National-Socialist Municipality\" exiled in France in 19th century and the works of Adam Mickiewicz, adopting \"Socialism, to be all-human one day, should become national in the first place\" as their motto. They declare a strong anti-German stance, opposing further German and Austrian influence over the economy and politics. Their main goal is \"victory over greedy capitalism\", represented mainly by foreign influence. PNS also advocates for the \"indivisible rule of the Polish working class\", that would be fulfilled by agrarian reform, nationalisation of big industries and parliamentary democracy. They are tolerant towards other Slavic nations and minorities, and propose a united Bloc of Slavic States.

Stachniuk declared that a new Great War is coming, one that will destroy Poland unless it frees itself from the chains of Christianity and modernity.\n\nWhat he terms \"Zadrugism\" is a belief that Christianity was created by the Jews, has only set Poland back, and only through liberation from Christianity and a return to the Old Slavic faith can the Poles become true to themselves. According to him, in an ideal world, society will not be organised through the state's coercion, but rather through the sheer will and morale of the people, who will form one classless Superculture.

 polandflavor.40.t: "Zakrzewski's Two Ideals"
 polandflavor.40.d: "Traditional Marxism holds a materialistic view of humanity, with no room for volkgeist and belief. The Syndicalism of Kazimierz Zakrzewski rejects this cynic materialism, and instead almost venerates the ideal worker, the nation, and the almost divine idea of revolution. Class is not something defined by person's wage, it is about choosing the idea. The worker, the producer, is a model for human being, creative and able to propel the civilisation forwards, while non-productive forces would rather drag it back to history. This identification with the worker's ideal requires personal revolution in the individual's soul, where he realizes his part in moving his nation forward in history.\n\nSimilarly, a nation is not only a collective of people, but rather a historical force in itself. Each nation has their own lives and values, inherent to them. Poland's role is to be the shining beacon of liberty and civilisation all across the Eastern Europe, just as France's is to be that beacon to the entire world. However, Zakrzewski's conception of nation is not restricted to language or culture, but rather some greater idea and direction of history. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forms one such idea, where multiple peoples were united in belief of liberty and civilisational creativity."

Small groups of far-right nationalists, barely armed and hardly trained, begun instigating their own protests, raids and acts of violence, rarely with success. \n\nThe town of Cyców was supposed to become a second Myślenice - over sixty men, half of them armed, arrived to the town at night, aiming to cut the telephone lines and begin a pogrom. However, to their surprise, the town was not defenseless - a small group of veterans of the Weltkrieg were visiting the town, and immediately took arms when they realised that something was amiss. In a quick firefight, the nationalist militia fled the town after several of their members were taken out before they could even register what was going on. \n\nAs inhabitants of the town reported after the fact, the veterans introduced themselves as "the Opera House", a small band with no purpose left but to defend their homeland against all threats. Though most of them were men, they were, supposedly, led by a woman, Jolanta Rowska. Who she or the Opera House are remains a mystery, and tabloids have run the story that it is actually a clandestine regiment of the Dwójka, tasked to eliminate opponents of the monarchy."
