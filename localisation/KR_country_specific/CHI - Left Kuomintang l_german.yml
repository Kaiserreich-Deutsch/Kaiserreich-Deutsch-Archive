### Ideas ###
 KR_CHI_start_army: "Insurgent Army"
 KR_CHI_start_army_desc: "Ten years of insurgency and clandestine activities have turned the core of the new NRA into a hardened group with experience in guerrilla warfare.\n\n§YAs the NRA transitions back into a conventional mass army, this National Spirit will disappear.§!"

 KR_CHI_popular_support_1: "Low Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_1_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it does not have the full support of the people in its goal to unify China under its banner. It will take a long period of state-building and military successes to get the people to see the Nationalist Government as legitimate, rather than as a slightly different kind of warlord or as dangerous stooges of the Syndicalists."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_2: "Insufficient Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_2_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it must be supported by some famous Chinese. A certain number of famous people are already supporting the Kuomintang government, but the Three People's Principles have not yet penetrated the civilian population."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_3: "Growing Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_3_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it must work to have the full support of the Chinese people. A growing number of Chinese both inside and outside of their controlled territory have become sympathetic or even supporters of the goals of the National Revolution."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_4: "Plurality Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_4_desc: "The Left Kuomintang's agenda and ideology are well known and supported by the Chinese people. A sizeable portion of the country now is at least comfortable with the idea of recognising the Nationalist Regime as the sole government of China."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_5: "High Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_5_desc: "The Nationalist Government established by the Kuomintang has paramount legitimacy in China, and patriotic Chinese citizens in all corners of the nation are supportive of their rule."

 CHI_EAC: "Economic Affairs Commission"
 CHI_EAC_desc: "The Economic Affairs Commission is the basic organisation that the National Government directs economic operations. It will be an important department for the implementation of various economic regulations."

 CHI_centralised_command: "Reinstated Joint Responsibility Law"
 CHI_centralised_command_desc: "As the League War breaks out, let us look to the centralised command structures of Europe and the West in order to strengthen the NRA. Like the Whampoa of past glories, we shall create a truly modern Chinese army - one that is disciplined and not prone to retreat. We shall reinstate the Joint-Responsibility Law of 1925 in order to ensure that our soldiers do not flee with their backs turned to the enemy!"

 CHI_revolutionary_spirit_idea_desc: "Whether it be in exile negotiating aid and support for the Kuomintang or fighting on the hills of Fujian, the dream of the Chinese National Revolution never died. With the NRA restored, it is fitting that the same revolutionary spirit of 1924 lives on!"

 CHI_revanchism: "Glorious Revanchism"
 CHI_revanchism_desc: "From the child in the classroom to the soldier on the battlefield, all must learn from an early age that there is nothing more glorious than to die for one's country.

 CHI_revolutionary_diplomacy_idea: "Revolutionary Diplomacy"
 CHI_revolutionary_diplomacy_idea_desc: ""Revolutionary Diplomacy" is the idea that the Kuomintang must revolutionise its external relations and that it must pursue a foreign policy programme that is unconventional, confident, and uncompromising towards imperialism. In order to achieve the survival of the Chinese people and the peaceful coexistence of all nations, China must take it upon herself to remove the yoke of imperialism and the unequal treaties. This is no longer a diplomacy of compromise nor is it a diplomacy devoid of principles, but rather a new enterprising and independent offensive."

### Parties ###
 CHI_totalist_party: "KMT-CRS"
 CHI_totalist_party_long: "China Reconstruction Society (Zhōngguó guómíndăng zhōnghuá fùxīng shè)\n\n§LThe China Reconstruction Society (CRS) is a clique formed by radical officers of the National Revolutionary Army and holds close ties with Dai Chunfeng's Zhongteju. Led primarily by Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi, the CRS emerged as a new political faction following the First National Congress and is especially popular amongst the military's young guard.\n\nTheir ideology consists of a host of influences from far-right Savinkovism to Maximist British economic planning, but the Sorelian necessity of violence most inspires them. The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a complete totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu. If China is to be saved, if she is to be liberated, and if she is to become a respected mighty power once more - she will have to be reconstructed from the ground up.§!\n"

 CHI_radical_socialist_party: "KMT-RCA"
 CHI_radical_socialist_party_long: "Reorganised Comrades Association of the Kuomintang (Zhōngguó guómíndăng gaizu tóngzhì huì)\n\n§LWhen the Kuomintang's left-wing dominated Central Committee fled to Europe following the end of the Northern Expedition, most left-wingers joined the Kuomintang Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA). The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the class base of the party or land reform.§!\n"

 CHI_syndicalist_party: "CSP"
 CHI_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party (Zhōngguó gōng tuán dăng)\n\n§LThe Chinese Syndicalist Party does not belong to the Kuomintang, even though many of its members hold close ties and believe in the \"Sun Yat-sen\" model of revolution. Nonetheless, they are allowed to participate in the Kuomintang's National Revolution as part of the Kuomintang's agreement with the Third Internationale for support.\n\nNonetheless, the CSP's movements and organisation are primarily confined to China's urban centres, such as the ports of the Legation Cities. As a result, their movement is broken and fragmented with nominal leadership ascribed to Chen Duxiu, who adheres to a more orthodox strain of syndicalism and advocates for a united front with his party and the Kuomintang. However, more radical syndicalist Chinese intellectuals, such as Wang Ming's so-called \"28 Syndicalists\" in France, adhere to the idea of the CSP as the sole carrier of revolution. The CSP is, therefore, viewed as both a foreign and a domestic threat by more conservative members of the Kuomintang, and their presence represents a potentially uneasy relationship with the Internationale.§!\n"

 CHI_social_democrat_party: "KMT-PAC"
 CHI_social_democrat_party_long: "Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang (Zhōngguó guómíndăng línshí xíngdòng wěiyuánhuì)\n\n§LThe Provisional Action Committee was formed during the League War by those who supported Song Qingling and distrusted the authoritarian nature of the returned Central Committee led by Wang Jingwei. Believing in the notion of achieving total socialism by the workers and the peasantry, the PAC draws its name from its desire for the Kuomintang to take action as a revolutionary vanguard with the masses gaining revolutionary consciousness and taking action as well.\n\nThe main ideological facets of the PAC is a total social revolution through democratic land reform to reward the land to those who till it, the installation of local self-governments as a result, and the necessity for China to adopt a method of \"National Capitalism\" to transition China from a feudal society into a socialist one. They see the Third Internationale as a temporary ally but view the Internationale nations as one of suspicion and are generally hostile to working with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen.§!\n"

 CHI_social_liberal_party: "KMT-Liberals"

 CHI_new_social_liberal_party: "KMT-OCC"
 CHI_new_social_liberal_party_long: "Overseas Chinese Commission of the Kuomintang (Guómíndăng qiáowù wěiyuánhuì)\n\n§LA relatively minor but influential lobby within the Kuomintang, the Overseas Chinese Commission was formed by Sun Fo (the son of the late Dr. Sun), Lian Shanghai, Liang Hanchao, and other Chinese expatriates who fled to non-socialist countries during the exile of the Kuomintang. As a result, many of these party members come from Hawaii, the United States, or Southeast Asia and represent the greater international diaspora of the Chinese community. They are ideologically not socialist but regard themselves as the party's centre-left wing and are known for their inclination towards democracy.§!\n"

 CHI_market_liberal_party: "Dang Wai"
 CHI_market_liberal_party_long: "Independent and Associated Republicans (Dăngwài)\n\n§LThe \"Dang Wai\" or party outsiders refers to those who participate in the Kuomintang's assemblies and Congresses as \"independent candidates\" but are not members of the Central Committee. As a result, they are hardly relevant to the Kuomintang but they represent republicans who support the platform of anti-imperialism and anti-warlordism but nonetheless, are not nominal members of the Kuomintang.§!\n"

 CHI_social_conservative_party: "Party Elders"
 CHI_social_conservative_party_long: "Party Elders of the Kuomintang (Guómíndăng zhanglao)\n\n§LThe party elders of the Kuomintang typically refer to the Four Elders of the Kuomintang (Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Renjie, and Li Shizeng). These elderly statesmen of the Kuomintang once were anarchists and had studied in France, where they helped encourage the development of the Work-Study programme. They represent the Kuomintang's Old Guard and had supported the revolution since its very beginnings - as such, they are effectively the party's \"genro\". Frequently sought after by major political players in the Kuomintang for favours or advice, they are known to be fiercely anti-syndicalist.§!\n"

 CHI_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Shanghai Cliques"
 CHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Shanghai Cliques\n\n§LRepresenting Kuomintang interests or political allies from the big businesses of the Shanghai Bund to the shadowy red-light district alleys of Shanghai's slums, the Kuomintang holds relations and communications with these organisations in the hopes of securing Nationalist support and influence in the Legation Cities. While linked to Central Committee members from Chen Gongbo to Zhang Renjie, they represent a source of financial and political support for the Kuomintang to be recognised as a national revolutionary movement.§!\n"

 CHI_paternal_autocrat_party: "Whampoa Clique"
 CHI_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Whampoa Clique (Huángpŭ jítuan)\n\n§LDuring his leadership as the headmaster of Whampoa Military Academy, the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek created a cult following amongst his right-wing students. They are also heavily influenced by the right-wing ideologue of the Kuomintang, Dai Jitao; they are considered to be the far-right of the Kuomintang. As a result, their presence is non-existent within the Kuomintang. However, there are rumours that they are connected to Dai Chunfeng and the China Reconstruction Society, although the CRS has dismissed all rumours of them courting open reactionaries.§!\n"

 CHI_national_populist_party: "Whampoa Extremists"
 CHI_national_populist_party_long: "Whampoa Extremists (Huángpŭ jíduān fēnzi)\n\n§LRepresenting the ultra-nationalist and far-right of the Kuomintang, the Whampoa Extremists come from the halls of Whampoa. They look to the model of Savinkovism as a means of saving the National Revolution and as such, there are rumours that they are connected to the China Reconstruction Society. Nonetheless, due to their highly reactionary views, they are virtually non-existent within the Kuomintang.§!\n"

 CHI_revolutionary_committee_of_the_kuomintang: "KMT-RC"
 CHI_revolutionary_committee_of_the_kuomintang_long: "Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (Zhōngguó Guómíndăng Gémìngwěiyuánhuì)\n\n§LOver the prolonged period of exile for the Chinese Kuomintang, multiple perspectives and interpretations of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's visions were formulated - leading to an incoherent overall party line. The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (once known as the Provisional Action Committee), led by Song Qingling, claims that it is the sole inheritor of the true vision of Dr. Sun's ideals - that the Chinese Revolution must also bring socialism for the workers and peasants.\n\nThe Revolutionary Committee is to be the sole vanguard of the revolution until the era of tutelage is complete. It sees its goals as not just a social revolution for China but also a nationalistic revolution and a democratic revolution - one that genuinely aims to liberate the oppressed masses of the land and to bring the notion of democracy to China. However, the Chinese revolution must be made in the Sun style - it is only through a provisional vanguard that the consciousness of the Chinese proletariat may unquestionably be revolutionised.§!\n"

Following the break between the right and the left wing, members of the Western Hills Clique fled for Shanghai, Russia, Southeast Asia, and beyond.

 CHI_jiangfu: "Establish JiangFu Base Government"
 CHI_jiangfu_desc: "With our uprising in full swing, the time has come to move out of the wilderness of Fujian Province and establish a provisional Nationalist government in areas under our control."

 CHI_ruijin_arsenal: "The 'Hundred Workshops' Arsenal"
 CHI_ruijin_arsenal_desc: "The centre of the Base Zone is remote and barely industrialised, which will be a problem as we switch to active warfare against the warlords. To mitigate our problems, a programme establishing a highly-decentralised manufacturing base for repairing and replacing infantry equipment needs to be established."

 CHI_literacy_programs: "Rural Literacy Programmes"
 CHI_literacy_programs_desc: "Much of the rural population of China is too poorly educated to be trained for modern warfare, let alone as specialists. The Reorganised Comrades Association, upon their arrival back onto the Chinese mainland, have endorsed programmes to provide literacy education for both adults and children should be implemented as soon as possible to counteract these problems."

 CHI_strike_AOG: "Seize German Capital"
 CHI_strike_AOG_desc: "The robber barons and imperialists of Germany have been content to let these local warlords abuse and harvest our nation's interior, while their commissioners idly collect the dividends in their 'treaty ports.' The KMT will not stand this any longer. Any capital held by the AOG shall be immediately requisitioned and any land seized must be taken from their foreign hands."

 CHI_consolidate_control: "Consolidate Control"
 CHI_consolidate_control_desc: "With our rebellion shifting towards conventional warfare, we must begin to also change our governing style as well. It is now essential that we begin governing the base region and other liberated territories as a functional state rather than as a secret rural government."

 CHI_est_navy: "Establish Naval Presence"
 CHI_est_navy_desc: "The Nationalists are in desperate need of a merchant marine and armed escorts that can connect us to friendly trading partners. Reorganising the commandeered seaworthy ships seized by our armies will take time, but it is an important step towards creating a new Chinese navy."

 CHI_jiangxi_rail: "Control The Central China Railroad"
 CHI_jiangxi_rail_desc: "The Central China Railroad- a local name for the new lines that connect Zhejiang to the interior- are critical for our supply lines in this early period of the revolution. Up until now, the railway has operated according to the demands of foreign capital, but we can run it more efficiently and with better purposes ourselves."

 CHI_warlord_research_group: "Extra-Military Research Coordination"
 CHI_warlord_research_group_desc: "Our alliances with the pro-KMT warlords will be ineffective if we do not cooperate to some extent. By sharing and mandating technical specifications with these armies, we can make sure that our forces and logistics will be able to operate anywhere that they need us to - or that we need them to."

 CHI_provisional_code: "Provisional Legal Code"
 CHI_provisional_code_desc: "During the early stages of the revolution, Chinese territory reclaimed by the Kuomintang has to be administered in a manner much different from the later democratic republic it will become. While supporting military operations must be prioritised, the Central Committee should also begin establishing civil courts and reintroduce the old organic law code to maintain peace, stability, and most importantly, tax revenues."

 CHI_expropriate_landlords: "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."

 CHI_land_rent_caps: "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."

 CHI_land_tax: "Land Use Tax"
 CHI_land_tax_desc: "The concept of a Land Value or Land Use Tax has been a policy darling of progressive reformers worldwide and is most associated with the economic theories of Henry George. Since the earliest days of the KMT, the Land Use Tax has been unanimously approved by the party, and its legal implementation will ensure both a continual source of income and a passive means of fighting wealth accumulation."

 CHI_opium_prohibition: "Opium Prohibition"
 CHI_opium_prohibition_desc: "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."

 CHI_opium_tax: "Tax The Opium Trade"
 CHI_opium_tax_desc: "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."

 CHI_gannan_deal: "Gannan New Deal"
 CHI_gannan_deal_desc: "There are proposals within the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (KMT-RC) faction to turn Gannan Province into a model region for future Chinese development. Social programmes such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

 CHI_yangste_offensive: "Secure Shandong"
 CHI_yangste_offensive_desc: "The League of Eight Provinces is shattered and anarchy reigns throughout the eastern seaboard of China. As the Kuomintang revolution finds fire beneath its wings once more, let us look towards liberating the Chinese people from the warlords and cultists who have done nothing to help the lives of the people. We will seek to unite all of Eastern China under the National Revolutionary Government in order to complete Dr. Sun's vision."

 CHI_expat_contacts: "Reach out to the Overseas KMT"
 CHI_expat_contacts_desc: "After the fall of the Northern Expedition, a considerable amount of KMT members fled overseas for places such as Southeast Asia and Hawaii. It is where they established expatriate KMT communities, hoping that one day the National Revolution will return to China. As our forces struggle to establish a foothold on the mainland at last, let us reach out to these overseas Chinese for their aid in the revolutionary struggle."

 CHI_establish_propaganda: "Create the Propaganda Administration"
 CHI_establish_propaganda_desc: "Soldiers must be encouraged to follow orders without hesitation and be prepared to defend the revolution at all costs. Let us rebuild our former propaganda departments so that we may reach out to the masses and to our armed forces, let us show China that we are indeed the only ones capable of achieving national salvation."

 CHI_VNQDD_liaisons: "Liaison with DVQDD Rebels"
 CHI_VNQDD_liaisons_desc: "The DVQDD, or 'Dai Viet Kuomintang,' is our sister organisation in Indochina and is just as devoted to the cause of democratic anti-imperialism in Asia as we are. With our borders touching the Indochinese region, we may be able to more closely aid and cooperate with them as part of their work within the wider world of native Indochinese politics."

 CHI_work_with_underground: "Our Connections to the Shanghai Underground"
 CHI_work_with_underground_desc: "In the heart of the most egregious examples of foreign imperialism over China, there remain plenty of those sympathetic to republican and nationalistic causes. A complicated web of patrons both licit and illicit has aided us in the past in smuggling weapons, people and information in and out of Jiangfu, keeping the flame of revolution alive in China through the darkest of days. Although many are suspicious of our socialist policies, we call upon them for aid nonetheless."

 CHI_plan_southern: "Unite Southern China"
 CHI_plan_southern_desc: "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."

 CHI_plan_western: "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_western_desc: "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

 CHI_mingshu: "Chen Mingshu Victorious"
 CHI_mingshu_desc: "With the KMT revolt in Fujian a failure it is now up to Chen Mingshu to ensure China is under Kuomintang rule. There are still problems facing Chen such as the powerful gentry and merchants, on top of that there is unrest in Liangguang which we will need to deal with."

 CHI_National_Plan: "The National Plan"
 CHI_National_Plan_desc: "With the National Plan we can use elements of Chen Jiongming's government to make the integration of China a lot easier. This is because his form of government was based on the American states which makes it more appealing for the governors as they can retain some autonomy for the time being."

 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming: "Implementing Guangdong Policies"
 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc: "The lands of the potential United Provinces are under our control however that doesn't mean we can't fulfil Chen's legacy. If we fine-tune his ideals to fit with ours we could gain a large amount of wealth and support from the people."

 CHI_guangdong_deal: "Guangdong New Deal"
 CHI_guangdong_deal_desc: "The Guangdong Province is a true example of a model region for future Chinese development. If we try to bring Social programmes such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing to other provinces in our control we may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang: "Consolidate Liangguang"
 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc: "The pressing issues that arose both before and after the civil war still need to be addressed, until they are sorted the Northern Expedition will have to wait until a later date which gives the enemy more time the prepare."

 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi: "Control the Unrest in Guangxi"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc: "Guangxi has not been spared the turmoil that has gripped large parts of China following the collapse of the League. Our new administration must tend to the unrest in this province, be it from reactionaries, bandits or Yiguandao agitators."

 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong: "Control the Unrest in Guangdong"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong_desc: "Much of this province still bears the influence of warlord dominance that threaten the stability of the people's government. Efforts should be made to put an end to their influence."

 CHI_expropriate_landlords2: "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords2_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."

 CHI_land_rent_caps2: "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps2_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."

 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC: "Reconcile with KMT in Sichuan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC_desc: "In the chaotic world of Sichuanese politics, the Officer Department is the only group with a favourable view of the KMT. By supporting Officer Department in their provincial power struggles, we could gain a valuable ally or even control of the entire province through them."

 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN: "Reconciliation with KMT in Yunnan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN_desc: "After the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the armies controlled by the Right KMT found refuge in Yunnan province. With the victory of the Centre-Right KMT in Yunnan's recent power struggles, we may have a chance to mend the old Nationalist party together and form a powerful front to unify South China together."

 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN: "Support KMT in Hunan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN_desc: "The only remaining democracy in Hunan was discovered by some members of the Kuomintang. However, Hunan Clique is still firmly controlled by non-KMT forces, and our revolutionary progress is developing very slowly there. By expanding the influence of KMT in Hunan Province, it will make it easier for us to revolutionise."

 CHI_Gentry_Concession: "Provide Gentry Concessions"
 CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc: "The gentry and their excesses are a product of a bad system. Instead of taking a heavy-handed approach, we can make concessions towards them and win their support. It'll be easier than fighting them every step of the way, allowing us to move forward with our reforms without major disruptions to the existing economic infrastructure."

 CHI_Gentry_Force: "Crack Down on the Gentry"
 CHI_Gentry_Force_desc: "The upper classes are but leeches that suck the blood out of the worker. Their excesses end here. We'll make them abide by the rules just like everyone else and work just like everyone else. There will be some inevitable transitional pains to the economy, but it's a price worth paying for justice."

 CHI_Merchants_Concession: "Provide Merchant Concessions"
 CHI_Merchants_Concession_desc: "While it's true that the merchant classes have lived off the people, we can't uproot the entire commercial system overnight. By making certain concessions to the merchant classes to have them support us and adapt to our rule, we should see a smoother transition for the people's government."

 CHI_Merchants_Force: "Crack Down on the Merchants"
 CHI_Merchants_Force_desc: "We cannot count the number of times that the merchants have squeezed every last penny out of the commoner without a care for his plight. It's time that we started to put the screws on these jackals and have them contribute to the common good for a change, even if that means that there will be a period of adjustment."

 CHI_Revoloution_Secured: "Revolution Secured"
 CHI_Revoloution_Secured_desc: "Our revolutionary brothers and sisters may have fallen, but not in vain. We shall pick up the torch of revolution where they left off and continue their work towards a better China. Through us, the Kuomintang rises again like a mighty phoenix!"

 CHI_plan_west: "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_west_desc: "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

 CHI_plan_east: "Strike East"
 CHI_plan_east_desc: "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."

 CHI_form_army: "The 2nd NRA"
 CHI_form_army_desc: "We are now in open revolt, and as such our military forces must move from insurgency tactics back to conventional warfare against the Warlords. More units must be raised in larger formations, and in doing so we will form a Second National Revolutionary Army to finally unify China."

 CHI_regional_militias: "Regional Militias"
 CHI_regional_militias_desc: "With the collapse of League authority in Fujian and Jiangxi province, local self-defence societies have formed to maintain order. We must try to integrate them into the NRA's structure as regional militias to bolster our small core forces."

 CHI_revolutionary_spirit: "Revive the Revolutionary Spirit"
 CHI_revolutionary_spirit_desc: "While the disaster of the First Northern Expedition convinced many that the Kuomintang movement was as good as dead, the revived NRA holds the same revolutionary sentiments and spirits of the first classes of Whampoa. Just like how our comrades at the Battle of Mianhu fought bravely despite being outnumbered, so too shall we fight to the last to ensure Dr. Sun's vision for a free China becomes reality."

 CHI_one_army: "Army of the Party"
 CHI_one_army_desc: "The NRA is an organ of the Kuomintang, a unique aspect amongst Chinese armies in that the NRA is highly monitored and controlled by the Party. To increase awareness of the Three Principles of the People and the standards of military behaviour, from the army corps to the divisions and the battalions - we will train and expand the political department to motivate and inspire our soldiers to carry out their duty!"

 CHI_tigress_battalions: "Tigress Battalions"
 CHI_tigress_battalions_desc: "The NRA has seen the equal valour of women in combat, though it has not yet developed any programmes to fully allow women to participate as enlisted soldiers or officers. Upon the urging of Song Qingling, the NRA has begun a formal programme to train women as officers and soldiers. The programme also envisions training all-female 'tigress battalions' for front line and garrison duties."

 CHI_peoples_army: "Legacy of the Jiangfu Insurgency"
 CHI_peoples_army_desc: "To create a modern revolutionary army, we need not look to the models of the West but rather to our native methods for dealing with war. Our forces will simply adapt to their growing battlefields and fronts, we shall harness the emphasis on speed and mobility with a focus on concentrated attacks. We shall bring honour to the legacy of the martyrs of the Jiangfu Insurgency and show our fallen comrades that their legacy is kept safe in the ongoing revolution."

 CHI_modern_divisions: "Look to the West"
 CHI_modern_divisions_desc: "Any new Chinese army needs to be founded again from first principles as a modern force. While we should try to maximise the number of units raised for the war, our equipment procurement and plans for expansion should prioritise creating new and modern forces that are not just superior to the haphazard divisions of the warlords, but equal in quality to those of western powers."

 CHI_mountain_warfare: "High Altitude Training"
 CHI_mountain_warfare_desc: "In the hills of Fujian, the flame of the Chinese National Revolution was kept alive. Even as we move towards a more conventional and mobile style of warfare, the skills learned there shall not be forgotten. Combined our training in exile with French Alpine infantry, our men can seize even the toughest crossings."

 CHI_dare_to_die: "Dare-To-Die Corps"
 CHI_dare_to_die_desc: "The Chinese soldier shall not fear death, no - he will embrace it for the sake of national salvation. After, the Qing were first overthrown in 1911 thanks to the efforts of revolutionary martyrs, martyrs who were willing to dare to die for their beloved nation. We will encourage the creation of such battalions, volunteers who are willing to fight for extra rations, extra cash to scale enemy walls, and positions with the end goal of encircling the enemy's armies."

 CHI_air_land_integration: "Air-Land Integration"
 CHI_air_land_integration_desc: "Control of the skies in the wars for China is both possible and plausible, and it is under these conditions that we can try to establish overwhelming aerial supremacy with the help of our foreign friends providing us with aircraft. In following the doctrine of the Western syndicalist nations of Britain and France, we shall seek to combine the use of coordinated offensives with aerial and land forces."

 CHI_expand_the_supply_corps: "Expand the Supply Corps"
 CHI_expand_the_supply_corps_desc: "China's infrastructure and geography make it incredibly difficult for supply to effectively move from depot to depot. As trucks and trains are in limited supply, we will reach out for foreign designs to design our own repurposed civilian trucks for military use. Furthermore, this will allow our soldiers to traverse far distances without starving to death."

 CHI_mechanized_warfare: "Mechanised Warfare Study Commission"
 CHI_mechanized_warfare_desc: "Armoured vehicles have been sparse in Chinese warfare, but regardless of our opinion that will not be for long. As a matter of national security, the Nationalists should be the first faction in China to study, perfect and introduce motorised vehicles and tank warfare into the Chinese theatre in mass numbers."

 CHI_encirclement_tactics: "Encirclement Detachments"
 CHI_encirclement_tactics_desc: "Like the enemies we faced in the Jiangfu Zone, our enemies will outnumber us and there is no way we can fight them head-on. We must hit them where they least expect it, creeping in the dead of night or crossing rivers and streams to outmanoeuvre and destroy their forces. Swift and fluid like water, formless and adaptable as we traverse through difficult terrain."

 CHI_soul_of_whampoa: "The Soul of Whampoa"
 CHI_soul_of_whampoa_desc: "In 1924, in a small island off the coast of Guangzhou, a new academy was established to defend the revolution and train a generation of men capable of driving out the wretched imperialists and warlords. Many have come and gone.  Some fought on, some lost hope, and many (like its first Headmaster) were martyred. The academy itself has moved multiple times. But the spirit of Whampoa lives on, and through the sacrifices of its men the White Sun may rise over China."

 CHI_modern_combined_arms: "Force Concentration"
 CHI_modern_combined_arms_desc: "They cannot deter our advance. From afar, we shall launch coordinated artillery strikes upon the enemy followed by our swift armoured cavalry and infantry - moving in near utmost tandem with only the most disciplined of China's infantry leading the charge. By applying such an overwhelming advancing force upon our enemies, we shall break even the firmest of enemy lines. None can withstand the impending national revolution, qilai!"

 CHI_restore_whampoa: "Restore The Academy"
 CHI_restore_whampoa_desc: "The old military academy in Whampoa was officially disestablished after the German intervention in China occupied Guangdong Province in 1925, but its staff, records, and other resources all survived and are currently spread across the world. We are now in a position to re-found the Republic of China Military Academy and begin training our officer corps independent of other powers."

 CHI_nat_air_army: "Create the Central Aviation School"
 CHI_nat_air_army_desc: "The concept of a modern Chinese air force may trace its lineage to the Nanyuan Air School but we trace the lineage of a true republican air force to Dr. Sun's Aviation Bureau in Guangzhou in 1920. With our forces re-established once more in the mainland, we will invite air experts from France and the Union of Britain to train and create a modern air force."

 CHI_flexible_aircraft: "Flexible Aircraft Specifications"
 CHI_flexible_aircraft_desc: "China does not have the mechanical skill or industrial depth to have the best native avionic designs for each application of air power in war. Because of these constraints, it is best to focus on producing cheap, reliable, and flexible plane designs that can work as both support craft and strategic bombers."

 CHI_heavy_airframes: "Heavy Airframes Focus"
 CHI_heavy_airframes_desc: "China is vast, and our air force will be stretched thin to cover all combat regions. Prioritising the development of long-distance, heavy-frame aircraft can allow us to let air wings be strategically flexible in their choice of targets or supporting missions."

 CHI_build_airfields: "Strategic Airfields Initiative"
 CHI_build_airfields_desc: "It is easier to build an airfield than a highway, and in the underdeveloped Chinese interior roads are scarce. Building strategic airfields at key regions in provinces will allow for both better communication with the Central Government and also allow for air support in nearby battle zones."

 CHI_naval_aviation: "Coast-to-Ship Air Support"
 CHI_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation in the sense of carrier forces is currently beyond China's capability or needs, but torpedo bombers and seaplanes are necessary for any proactive coastal defence. Anti-ship squadrons that are stationed on land will be just as useful in repelling attacks and securing littoral zones as any aircraft carrier."

 CHI_separate_naval_command: "Separate Naval Command"
 CHI_separate_naval_command_desc: "Up until now much of the Republic of China Navy has been effectively subordinated to the needs of the NRA. However, any nation that wants security on its own terms needs to have a strong navy. As victories mount on land, Admiral Chen Shaokuan has pushed for more independence for the Navy and for serious consideration of building up a navy capable of independent operations at sea."

 CHI_coastal_fleets: "Light Ship Focus"
 CHI_coastal_fleets_desc: "China's naval forces have always been reliant on foreign shipyards and designers for its fleets. The first generation of all-Chinese fleet production should focus on the development of light and heavy cruisers for the most economical and versatile results, as opposed to plunging into the more doctrinally-uncertain world of battleships and carriers."

 CHI_coastal_defenses: "Coastal Defence Stratagems"
 CHI_coastal_defenses_desc: "China's greatest naval concern is securing its coastline against the imperial powers. Coordination between all involved parties- coastal NRA garrisons, air wings, and the navy- should be enforced by the Central Government and specific mixed-service chains of command and protocols should be pre-established to prevent any operational chaos."

 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy: "Fate of Beiyang Naval Staff"
 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy_desc: "The Nationalist government's navy is small and lacking in trained officers. While the warlordism of the Zhili army is irredeemable, the Beiyang Navy's command structure may have enough officers of decent moral quality that it may be beneficial to review their records and offer the trustworthy a commission now that the Qing and Zhili jackals have finally been put down."

 CHI_submarine_doctrine: "Study Submarine Warfare"
 CHI_submarine_doctrine_desc: "Submarine warfare has allowed other nations with a seeming naval disadvantage to strike fear into the merchant marines of their enemies. Given the effectiveness of these forces during the Weltkrieg and afterwards, many admirals argue that the ROCN should turn towards submarine warfare as a way to leapfrog past the old paradigm of surface navies with vulnerable capital ships."

 CHI_contest_ijn: "Prepare to Contest the IJN"
 CHI_contest_ijn_desc: "To the east lies Japan, and their Imperial Japanese Navy has humiliatingly destroyed the Beiyang fleet and stripped away Taiwan from us at the end of the 19th century. Today the IJN continues to menace our coast, threatening a blockade and providing Japan with a major advantage in the event of war. To nullify this threat, we must prepare countermeasures, including the possibility of reclaiming our lost island."

 CHI_navy_of_revolution: "Navy of the National Revolution"
 CHI_navy_of_revolution_desc: "Although the national revolution has been won primarily on land, if we are to build a prosperous and independent Chinese state the foundation must include security in our coastline and at seas. Although building sufficient capital ships to match imperialist powers is perhaps too lofty of a goal for now, we have the expertise and resources to churn out naval forces to keep our enemies on their toes."

 CHI_naval_infantry: "Chinese Naval Infantry"
 CHI_naval_infantry_desc: "The modern art of coastal landings opens up not just unexpected feints across the Yellow Sea or Gulf of Hanoi, but also the retaking of Taiwan from the Japanese. A joint programme by the NRA and ROCN to develop specialised naval infantry regiments will help to keep our enemies on their toes and our strategic options as open as the ocean's horizon."

 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn: "Military Affairs Commission"
 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn_desc: "With the expansion of the NRA into multiple branches in multiple front regions, a new central command overseeing all theatres of the revolution must be established. Though a formality, this commission should ensure that all decision-makers are on the same page and know our capabilities."

 CHI_sanmin_commissars: "Sanmin Political Commissars"
 CHI_sanmin_commissars_desc: "The National Revolution that we are fighting for is not just a series of military campaigns, but a social and political revolution. We must make sure that our officers make field decisions in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and our political goals. To this end, the Party has assigned political commissars to military units both for education in Sanmin ideology and to advise officers in political affairs."

 CHI_special_methods_division: "Special Methods Division"
 CHI_special_methods_division_desc: "As we liberate more and more provinces of China from the warlords and nobles, those that benefited from their regimes will inevitably resist us. To overcome this, we'll train and deploy specialised commissars to deal with reactionaries behind the lines."

 CHI_new_dockyards: "Intensify Dockyard Construction"
 CHI_new_dockyards_desc: "With the Warlord Era redirecting most resources towards land forces and many coastal cities having been seized by foreign concessions, the Chinese navy has struggled to receive the focus needed to even defend the Chinese coastline. Having defeated our continental enemies, it is high time that we begin reprioritising the navy, including building large-scale naval infrastructure to once more contest the seas."

 CHI_reclaim_taiwan: "Liberate Taiwan"
 CHI_reclaim_taiwan_desc: "The island of Taiwan was surrendered to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese war and has suffered under their jackboot ever since. With our positions on the mainland secured and both our army and navy built up, we're finally in a position to liberate the island of Taiwan and to ensure finally the reunification of our peoples once and for all. Wansui!"

 CHI_1st_congress: "First Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_desc: "After a decade overseas, the Central Committee of the KMT has returned to China in triumph. Now that the initial war against the Nanjing Clique is complete, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."

 CHI_1st_congress_GXC: "First Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_GXC_desc: "After the decisive defeat of the KMT in Fujian the Left Kuomintang was thought to be over for good. This changed however as Chen Mingshu managed to bring the revolution to Liangguang and prevent the fall of republicanism in China. Now that many internal issues have been put to rest, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."

 CHI_revive_china: "Revive China Programme"
 CHI_revive_china_desc: "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast programme of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West."

 CHI_national_RC: "National Reconstruction Commission"
 CHI_national_RC_desc: "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide programme of capital investments and standardisations. This programme will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population areas."

 CHI_1st_industrial: "First Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_1st_industrial_desc: "The first planned phase of industrialisation for each base region will involve expanding the infrastructural capacity and heavy industries needed for future construction."

 CHI_standard_rail_gauges: "Standardised Railway Gauges"
 CHI_standard_rail_gauges_desc: "Railway development in China has been sporadic in particular the warlord governments have intentionally chosen gauges different from those of their regional rivals to prevent any easy invasion, and foreign firms would use whatever gauge was cheapest to build tunnels and bridges for. As part of our industrial programmes, we must invest time and effort into converting all our railways to the standard gauge."

 CHI_2nd_industrial: "Second Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_2nd_industrial_desc: "The second planned phase of industrialisation for each base region involves the development of factories reliant on fine toolings, such as consumer goods and military munitions."

 CHI_natl_dockyard: "National Dockyard Effort"
 CHI_natl_dockyard_desc: "As part of our larger industrialisation plans, major ports under our control should have their capabilities for shipbuilding and repair expanded."

 CHI_academica_sinica: "Academica Sinica"
 CHI_academica_sinica_desc: "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."

 CHI_bopomofo: "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
 CHI_bopomofo_desc: "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."

 CHI_foreign_research: "Foreign Research Partnerships"
 CHI_foreign_research_desc: "Like it or not, the Nationalist Government cannot modernise the country without working with the international scientific community. By forming research and graduate training agreements with friendly foreign powers, we can start to build up China's own scientific prowess"

 CHI_proclaim_new_republic: "Assert Independence from Beijing"
 CHI_proclaim_new_republic_desc: "Our government's independence from Beijing has been self-evident for some time. Declaring an official declaration of independence, whilst only giving us some support within our government, will show our opposition to the Qing monarchists. This act will remind the world that we are not just 'The Kuomintang' but instead the Nationalist Government and the rightful heir to the Xinhai Revolution."

 CHI_develop_the_capital: "Develop our Capital"
 CHI_develop_the_capital_desc: "To strengthen our foothold and increase popular support within the masses, let us turn away from military affairs and focus on developing the infrastructure of our national capital. Not only will this help develop our native industry but it will also help build our legitimacy with the people."

 CHI_build_national_mausoleum: "Build the National Mausoleum"
 CHI_build_national_mausoleum_desc: "With the capital established, it is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of the Chinese National Revolution. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and other prominent revolutionaries."

 CHI_new_culture_movement: "National Culture Movement"
 CHI_new_culture_movement_desc: "Chinese civilisation can be seen as a continuous cultural tradition and identity thousands of years old, but this has not yet really translated into a 'nationalism' as strong or dynamic as that created and practised by European powers. A civic nationalism greater than any warlord's cynical appeals to federalism needs to be instilled by cultural grants, public works, and sponsored mass media."

 CHI_est_civil_service: "Establish Civil Service"
 CHI_est_civil_service_desc: "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation, even at such an early stage as this."

 CHI_provisional_legislature: "Provisional Legislative Yuan"
 CHI_provisional_legislature_desc: "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. A provisional legislature, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."

 CHI_ethnic_autonomy: "Ethnic Autonomous Regions"
 CHI_ethnic_autonomy_desc: "Within the 18 provinces that make up China there is a myriad of ethnic groups, many of whom have painful memories of repression from the Han and Manchu. Rather than reopening these old wounds by ruling with a strong hand, we'll mend them by granting these ethnic groups a degree of self-rule within our nation."

 CHI_unitary_state: "Unitary Government"
 CHI_unitary_state_desc: "Whether it's by class or ethnicity, the last thing China needs is more division and splintering. In order to better pursue the interests of all the people of China in these turbulent times, a strong and centralised state is needed to safeguard our young republic against reactionary forces."

 CHI_rec_syndies: "Recognise Urban Syndicalists"
 CHI_rec_syndies_desc: "The support from syndicalists, be it aid from foreign states or local groups rising up to stand up for their rights, was vital in securing our revolution. In light of this, we should allow them to have a greater voice in the organisation of labour as well."

 CHI_national_labour: "All-China National Labour Syndicate"
 CHI_national_labour_desc: "While we appreciate the aid from syndicalists in our liberation struggle we must also be the ones that decide our own fate. As such, the Kuomintang will remain the only institution in China with a guiding voice on labour relations in China during the period of tutelage."

 CHI_local_democracy: "Local Democratic Government"
 CHI_local_democracy_desc: "Democracy is one of the three principles of the people. In order to fulfil the vision of Dr Sun Yat-sen, we should embrace democratic institutions all the way down to the local level and give the people of China the voice they've been denied for millennia."

 CHI_continued_tutelage: "Continued Tutelage"
 CHI_continued_tutelage_desc: "Before we can move on to fully embrace the democratic aspect of the Three Principles of the People, a transitional period of political tutelage is required. During this period, the Kuomintang shall remain the only political party with a final say on national matters."

 CHI_dais_coup: "Dai's Coup"
 CHI_dais_coup_desc: "Should the Kuomintang's leadership stray too far from its founding principles they can expect dire consequences from those who they least expect..."

 CHI_legalize_parties: "Legalise Pro-Revolution Parties"
 CHI_legalize_parties_desc: "The Kuomintang has been the only legal political party during our transitional period of political tutelage. This has excluded several parties sympathetic to our revolutionary cause from having the voice they deserve to have. We should end this injustice by opening up our system to them as well."

 CHI_social_revolution: "Embrace the Chinese Social Revolution"
 CHI_social_revolution_desc: "The Chinese revolution is not merely a revolution to overthrow the corrupt warlords and foreign imperialists that have long humiliated our country. It is also a revolution for the workers and peasants who are the true people of China, for it is by their efforts that we have our country. And this is the final evolution of the Minsheng principle, the achievement of true equality for the Chinese Proletariat."

 CHI_purge: "Purification of the Party Organ"
 CHI_purge_desc: "The only way to save the Chinese Revolution is to enact the so-called permanent purge of the party from its corrupt elements. For this is how the First Northern Expedition failed, the degenerate excesses of democracy contributed to its failure. We aim to create a mass violence organisation, one that takes the people of the nation as its highest principle."

 CHI_state_capitalism: "Capitalism under the State"
 CHI_state_capitalism_desc: "While we ascribe to a nominally socialist ideology in regards to our economic development, the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen did envision that the newly revolutionary government should embrace an economic model controlled by the state. This will allow us to nationalise what has long been exploited from us while preparing for our economy to inevitably embrace socialism. However, without existing capital - we will need to build capital from the ground up with our New Economic Zones."

 CHI_state_collectivism: "Total Land Nationalisation"
 CHI_state_collectivism_desc: "We cannot trust man in dealing with his neighbour's property and land. Land and property must be dealt with by the state, only by the guiding hand of the Party shall we achieve total equality throughout the country. We shall take steps to completely nationalise land and create agricultural collective cooperatives in order to increase our agricultural yields for the national revolution."

 CHI_1st_national_elections: "First National Elections"
 CHI_1st_national_elections_desc: "The time has finally come to fully unchain the people's power. By holding our first national election of many to come, the people will finally have a government that truly represents their will on both a local and national level."

 CHI_deepen_party_state: "Deepen the Party-State"
 CHI_deepen_party_state_desc: "For far too long the people of China have lived under self-serving regimes that neglected them and their needs. Under the broadened tutelage of the Kuomintang, they'll finally be guided by a firm yet caring hand that puts their welfare and livelihoods before all else."

 CHI_reborn: "Total Militarisation"
 CHI_reborn_desc: "Revived, Reborn, and Regenerated. Too long has our country suffered under the excesses of liberals and democrats, held down from progress by hopeless ideologues such as the Federalists. No longer. Our country has been reborn into a perfect totalitarian socialist state - one that shall never falter to enemies both foreign and domestic. We are united evermore in our shared Han lineage, since the Warring States, the Three Kingdoms - this is how it has always been."

 CHI_northern_expedition: "Complete the Revolutionary Mission"
 CHI_northern_expedition_desc: "With our position in the former League of East Provinces secured, the time has come for the National Revolutionary Army to begin serious planning for a strike northwards against the Qing. This time, no foreign aid will be enough to help the Zhili warlords or their puppet emperor!"

 CHI_deal_with_north_warlords: "Diplomacy with Northern Warlords"
 CHI_deal_with_north_warlords_desc: "The war for Northern China requires careful consideration of the politics in the region. One area of particular interest is Shanxi which is known to be the neutral clique, home of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. We are presented with a choice to force them open or consider the opportunistic nature of their leader if they are aligned with another government."

 CHI_negotiate_FNG: "Negotiate with Marshal Zhang"
 CHI_negotiate_FNG_desc: "With the costs of war fresh in our minds, diplomacy with the old Beiyang government could be preferable to outright war. If a deal can be reached it might provide us with an opportunity to defeat the [QIE.GetName] once and for all."

 CHI_invade_FNG: "Cross the Dai River"
 CHI_invade_FNG_desc: "North of the Dai River lies the Fengtian government, a Japanese lapdog state that wants nothing more than to do the bidding of their imperialist masters in Tokyo. It's time that we took them down once and for all and liberated their Manchurian holdings from Tokyo's yoke."

 CHI_anti_JAP: "War of Anti-Imperialism"
 CHI_anti_JAP_desc: "The imperialists in Tokyo have ruthlessly exploited our lands and people for decades, seeking to turn us into slaves and our lands into mere resource deposits for their army. Now we must rally the people for the struggle ahead as we once more find ourselves at war with the regime in Tokyo!"

 CHI_reorder_north_china: "Assert Central Authority"
 CHI_reorder_north_china_desc: "With the success of the Second Northern Expedition, the time has come to pacify the rest of China. Therefore in accordance with the Kuomintang's programme, we must ensure the proper transition from military rule to nationwide political tutelage. Anyone who still stands in our way- shall be swept aside."

 CHI_institute_of_revolutionary_practice_desc: "China has at last been unified but the revolution is far from complete. We cannot let our comrades fall astray of the revolutionary methods and teachings of the late Dr. Sun nor should they neglect to carry out the revolutionary spirit.

 CHI_avenge_northern_expedition_desc: "The first Northern Expedition could have been achieved and the unification of our country much earlier - had it not been for the involvement of the German Empire. Too long have they held onto our territories in Shandong. We shall seek to have them returned to the Republic of China - either by the pen or by the sword."

 CHI_authority_TIB_desc: "The erosion of Qing control earlier in the century meant that the province of Tibet ended up slipping into theocratic self-rule. We must figure out how to best deal with them."

 CHI_neutralize_RUS: "Neutralise Russian Imperialism"
 CHI_neutralize_RUS_desc: "Like many other European powers, the Russians have simply seen China as a resource deposit ripe for exploitation.

 CHI_renounce_mcmahon: "Renounce the McMahon Lines"
 CHI_renounce_mcmahon_desc: "The product of the British colonial administrator Henry McMahon, this line infringes on Chinese sovereignty and is yet another example of European colonisers trying to dictate their will to us.

### Events ###
 chi_dom.1.t: "Return of the Central Committee"
 chi_dom.1.d1: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Wenzhou. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Wenzhou would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."
 chi_dom.1.d2: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Xiamen. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Xiamen would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."
 chi_dom.1.d3: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee arrived in small groups through the legation port of Fujian and has travelled secretly to Longyan. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. With Song Qingling present, Wang Jingwei later delivered a speech outside Longyan's City Hall, congratulating the JiangFu soldiers on holding out thus far.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates returned via Fujian's ports in small squads. A large cache of smuggled rifles and ammunition provided by the Commune is currently being distributed via backchannels."
 chi_dom.1.a: "Welcome back, Chairman Wang."

 chi_dom.2.t: "The Harvest of 1936"
 chi_dom.2.d: "Before the National Revolution began, the soldiers living in the Jiangxi-Fujian Insurgent Zone would assist local peasants in the autumn rice harvests. With the NRA back to fighting a conventional struggle, there are fewer hands than usual to help the heart of the revolution with agriculture."
 chi_dom.2.a: "They'll have to get used to these changes for the greater good."
 chi_dom.2.b: "Divert new recruits to get some moral training in the fields."

 chi_dom.3.t: "Leader of The Sanqingtuan"
 chi_dom.3.d: "Recently, Dai Chunfeng has suggested calling for more youths to participate in the revolution of Three People's Principles. The proposal of establishing the Sanqingtuan is regarded by most people as a sign of ZhongTeJu's expansion. However, much to their surprise, it seems that Dai Chunfeng is unlikely to directly appoint a leader of the Sanqingtuan, which offers us an opportunity. Zhou Enlai proposes that the splendid Youth general\n\nXiao Ke is best qualified for this position due to his superior leadership skills, while Song Qingling suggests our "Big Sister" Cai Chang is the better choice, as her image as the "Tigress soldier" will make for excellent propaganda."
 chi_dom.3.a: "Choose Cai Chang."
 chi_dom.3.b: "Choose Xiao Ke."

 chi_dom.4.t: "Liao Zhongkai Dies"
 chi_dom.4.d1: "Earlier this morning, in the company of his family, the KMT veteran and revolutionary hero Liao Zhongkai passed away in his sleep. Many of the leading figures in the KMT attended his funeral, including the current KMT leader Wang Jingwei. While the KMT members are mourning his death, Chen Gong bo, one of Wang Jingwei's assistants and political allies, inherits Liao's place, and announces that he will carry on Liao's legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career."
 chi_dom.4.d2: "Earlier this morning, in the company of his family, the KMT veteran and revolutionary hero Liao Zhongkai passed away in his sleep. Many of the leading figures in the KMT attended his funeral, including the current KMT leader [CHI.GetLeader]. While KMT members are mourning his death, [CHI.GetLeader] encourages KMT members to carry on Liao's legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career."
 chi_dom.4.a: "He will be missed."

 chi_dom.5.t: "Incidents in Wenzhou"
 chi_dom.5.d: "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
 chi_dom.5.a: "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

 chi_dom.6.t: "Tragedy in Nantong"
 chi_dom.6.d: "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangtze allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai was overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangtze, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernised, Nantong has effectively been sacked."
 chi_dom.6.a: "A great loss for the country."

 chi_dom.7.t: "Fujianers in Hangzhou"
 chi_dom.7.d: "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianer soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."
 chi_dom.7.a: "It's an unavoidable problem of national unification."

 chi_dom.8.t: "The Zhou Fohai Affair"
 chi_dom.8.d: "The Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, but adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the Yiguandao. With the National Revolution now fighting against the forces of the Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran, the ZhongTeJu has begun extensive counter-intelligence sweeps to purge secret Yiguandao practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent secret Millenarian revealed so far has unexpectedly been Zhou Fohai, a Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA) faction member. Zhou has been asked to resign all his posts under duress by the opposition, with some even demanding his expulsion from the party. [CHI.GetLeader] needs to make a statement soon to the Central Committee before further knives get sharpened."
 chi_dom.8.a: "This is an embarrassment..."
 chi_dom.8.b: "Comrade Zhou is nothing like that!"

 chi_dom.9.t: "The Premiere of Mulan Cong Jun"
 chi_dom.9.d: "Today saw the premiere of one of the first feature films created under Nationalist China's rule. Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan, who in a show of filial piety joins the army in her father's place to fight off invading nomads. Hailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and has raised patriotic feelings throughout the country, along with an inevitable flood of popular comparisons between Hua Mulan and Song Qingling."
 chi_dom.9.a: "How exciting!"

 chi_dom.10.t: "The Premiere of The Spring River Flows East"
 chi_dom.10.d: "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two-part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working-class couple in Zhejiang during the trials and tribulations of the National Revolution. Portraying the corruption that greed and power hold over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the moderate parties. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."
 chi_dom.10.a: "I say, it's the stuff that dreams are made of!"

 chi_dom.11.t: "Victory in the Five Provinces"
 chi_dom.11.d: "After nearly a decade in exile, we have achieved the impossible. Driven into humiliating exile, we were forced to improvise, adapt, and overcome. While our fighting methods may be unconventional for the rest of China, our prowess and skill were displayed in our glorious victory in the League War against the imperialists and reactionaries. Now that we finally have space to breathe, we can begin inspecting our army - whether or not we will focus our efforts on our vast manpower or modernise our forces will be subject to debate at an inevitable repatriated congress of the Kuomintang. Our victory over the League is indeed glorious, now we are capable and ready to carry out Dr Sun's legacy and bring the national revolution to China, once and for all!"
 chi_dom.11.a: "Zhonghua Minguo Wansui!"

 chi_dom.18.t: "Sun Fo Forms an Opposition"
 chi_dom.18.d1: "The first Party Congress of the KMT ended with the Reorganised Faction keeping its leadership. After the Congress, the Left Kuomintang's non-socialist faction, led by Sun Fo, blamed the Provisional Action Committee Faction, under Song's leadership, for being too lax during the struggle for the KMT leadership. This led to the long-brewing conflict between them finally breaking out. After a fallout with no resolve, Sun Fo and his followers became angry and left, then declared the establishment of their opposing faction - formed mostly of overseas liberal Chinese. It seems that as the Reorganised Faction strengthens their control of central power and the tutelage, the Provisional Action Committee Faction's chances of gaining power are growing slim."
 chi_dom.18.d2: "The first Party Congress of KMT ended with Song Qingling's Provisional Action Committee Faction overtaking the Reorganised Faction as leaders of the KMT. After the Congress, the non-socialist opposition, led by Sun Fo, formed an oppositional party, citing that Song's faction's dreams of socialism were too idealistic for the sake of the Chinese Revolution. Although Song Qingling tries to persuade them to join in a united Kuomintang faction, Sun Fo and his followers have decided to leave. It seems that if the newly established Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang calls for an election, Sun Fo and his followers will participate as an independent faction."
 chi_dom.18.a: "A pity."

 chi_dom.19.t: "End of the First Repatriated Congress"
 chi_dom.19.d1: "Now that the congress has officially concluded we must look to reclaiming China for the people. We have a series of reconstruction plans in mind to help prepare our industry to unify China as well as the reforms proposed at the congress to complete, we have quite the task ahead of us but we must succeed."
 chi_dom.19.d2: "Now that the congress has officially concluded we must look to reclaiming China for the people. We have a series of reconstruction plans in mind to help prepare our industry to unify China as well as the reforms proposed at the congress to complete, we have quite the task ahead of us but we must succeed."
 chi_dom.19.a: "Very well."

 chi_dom.20.t: "The New Cabinet of the Revolutionary Committee"
 chi_dom.20.d: "We have a choice between two prominent members of Song Qingling's faction to serve in the new revolutionary government of the Kuomintang. The first is Eugene Chen, also known as Chen Youran, an overseas Chinese lawyer from Trinidad. Having grown up far from the Chinese mainland and raised in a western setting, Chen is illiterate in Chinese, but his western mannerisms make him an ideal link between the Third Internationale and the Kuomintang. An early comrade of Dr. Sun from the early days of the Chinese Revolution, Chen's diplomatic tact, British education, and eloquence have made him an essential liaison in organising support and advisors from the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. The second choice is newcomer Deng Yingchao, the wife of the political commissar Zhou Enlai, who was a team leader during the protests regarding the exposure of the Nishihara loans. During the insurgent period in the Jiangfu zone, Yingchao developed pulmonary tuberculosis but remained a powerful symbol for the modernisation of Chinese women in the Revolution."
 chi_dom.20.a: "Eugene Chen will be a fitting choice!"
 chi_dom.20.b: "Deng Yingchao shall do well!"

 chi_dom.21.t: "Two-Gun Cohen"
 chi_dom.21.d: "Morris Abraham Cohen, otherwise known as Two-Gun Cohen, served in the Canadian Railway Troops during the Weltkrieg before eventually making his way to China to conduct business with Sun Yat-sen. After bonding with him, Morris started working for the KMT, helping train troops until he was offered to become one of Sun Yat-sen's many bodyguards. He eventually got the name Two-Gun Cohen after one battle where he was nicked by a bullet and decided to always carry two guns with him. After going back to Canada due to the disastrous campaign of the Northern Expedition he has once again visited China offering the same protection that he gave Sun Yat-sen."
 chi_dom.21.a: "We will never need to watch our backs..."

 chi_dom.22.t: "Chiang Wei-Kuo Commissioned"
 chi_dom.22.d: "With the formation of the Mechanised Warfare Study Commission, an exiled man skilled in mechanised warfare has arrived: none other than Chiang Wei-Kuo. The alleged son of the former generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (although many within the Kuomintang suspect him of being the biological son of its leading right-wing ideologue, Dai Jitao); Chiang Wei-Kuo has just returned from the Union of Britain, where he studied under British tank advocates such as B.H. Liddel Hart and Percy Hobart. As the National Revolutionary army lacks many officers and generals who were inexperienced in armoured and mechanised warfare, Chiang Wei-Kuo eagerly accepted a new post as a freshly commissioned general in the NRA's new armoured and motorised detachments."
 chi_dom.22.a: "He will help introduce new doctrine."

 chi_dom.24.t: "Cooperation With Foreign Powers"
 chi_dom.24.d: "It is true, China needs foreign aid to industrialise and so we must look to the syndicalist power of the world and see if they are willing to help us in our reconstruction."
 chi_dom.24.a: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice."
 chi_dom.24.b: "[CSA.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice."
 chi_dom.24.c: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice."

 chi_dom.25.t: "A Request From China"
 chi_dom.25.d: "The Nationalist government in China has come to us with an offer of cooperation in building up their industry, they suggest we share new innovations with each other for mutual aid. Whilst we may not gain many new technologies from China we can at least help them modernise."
 chi_dom.25.a: "China has our support."
 chi_dom.25.b: "We will not cooperate with the Kuomintang."

 chi_dom.26.t: "Our Offer has Been Accepted"
 chi_dom.26.d: "Now that our offer has been accepted we can now enjoy the benefits of working with a foreign power, as much as it may pain us to work with syndicalists it is better than working with Germany."
 chi_dom.26.a: "A toast to our friendship."

 chi_dom.28.t: "A Mysterious Letter"
 chi_dom.28.d: "An encrypted letter was uncovered by accident by a party member. The letter is handwritten and discussed in length how the current state of the party is unstable and in need of dire reform. The letter also goes on to talk about a potential change in the management of the party. Due to the heavy encryption of both the source and the recipient we can't track the letter down to any one person so we will have to remain vigilant."
 chi_dom.28.a: "Let's hope this was a prank..."

 chi_dom.29.t: "The Source"
 chi_dom.29.d: "If the letter wasn't unsettling enough, we've caught the person who was the source of the letter. Even under heavy interrogation, the person was reluctant to even speak a word about the letter, which doesn't give any hope that it is a small matter. We have no choice but to continue the interrogation until the information is given to us. This could take some time."
 chi_dom.29.a: "This has to be a small conspiracy, right?"

 chi_dom.30.t: "An Innocent Meeting"
 chi_dom.30.d: "There are many people sitting around a large circular table. Many appear to be officers both old and new from Whampoa Military Academy whilst some are radicals not found in any high-up positions of the party. Our spy was unable to gather anything beyond that, but he has his suspicions that there is a more sinister purpose to this meeting."
 chi_dom.30.a: "We need to keep an eye on these meetings."
 chi_dom.30.b: "This is nonsense, forget about the meeting."

 chi_dom.31.t: "A Matter of State"
 chi_dom.31.d: "The spy stayed a bit longer in the next weekly meeting of the group he has been informing us about and has come to us with urgent news. Like last time the conversation was the same until at a certain point all members of the meeting nodded slowly. After assuring each other that they were secure they began discussing in detail the depth of the infiltration. As the discussion progressed the spy was alarmed when one officer reportedly said that the plan will commence in less than a month. The spy had to hurry out of the building to avoid being spotted but this discussion was more than enough to incriminate those attending."
 chi_dom.31.a: "Send a detachment of police to investigate."

 chi_dom.32.t: "The Conclusion of the Investigation"
 chi_dom.32.d: "The police who were sent to investigate the people attending the meeting have reported that nothing suspicious is going on and that the spy must have been lying. This is highly odd as he is one of our most trusted spies and would never lie to us, something must be going on here."
 chi_dom.32.a: "What is going on!?"

 chi_dom.33.t: "The plot is exposed"
 chi_dom.33.d: "It seems like forever since we found that letter but after many days of work we have found out the person the letter was addressed to is none other than Dai Chunfeng!"
 chi_dom.33.a: "This is a very serious matter, arrest him!"

 chi_dom.34.t: "The CRS Coup"
 chi_dom.34.d: "The situation was far worse than we originally expected. Like the spy had heard in the meeting, the bureaucracy has been vastly infiltrated, with every element now loyal to Dai first and the party second. While the reports are coming through-  the Spy knocks on the party leader's door -after the door opens, two soldiers are seen behind the spy, and he whispers to us, "I am sorry. With Dai's influence entrenched in every facet of the Kuomintang, the revolution has suddenly taken a vastly different turn.\n\nMembers of both Wang and Song's faction have suddenly disappeared virtually overnight, with rumours of many confessing that to crimes of aiding the reactionary warlord Chen Jiongming and sponsoring anti-revolution thoughts. It would appear that the China Reconstruction Society had been in leagues with Dai Chunfeng's Zhongteju - with the CRS being prevalent amongst the radical wing of the National Revolutionary Army and the Zhongteju often assassinating those the CRS deemed a threat.\n\nGeneral Hu Zongnan, a general known to hold radical views towards the direction of the Kuomintang, and the de-facto leader of the CRS has announced in a public address (with Dai Chunfeng behind him), that martial law and trials were to be held in the coming days to establish order and to revive the revolutionary spirit once more."
 chi_dom.34.a: "An unexpected turn of events."

 chi_dom.35.t: "First National Elections"
 chi_dom.35.d: "There have been many unelected leaders of the Kuomintang over the years, not even when Sun Yat-sen led the glorious revolution as the first and eternal premier of the Kuomintang. They realised that the unstable position of the Kuomintang meant no elected leader would have the will nor the power to come out on top. Since the revived Kuomintang movement rose up as an insurgent state we have evolved to a fully functioning democracy so it is only right that we hold elections. There are a few parties running as independent "outsiders" or "Dang Wai" parties but it is quite clear to all who can read the writing on the wall - that the Kuomintang is poised to once more command national leadership. As the polling finishes throughout the country, the winner is indisputably..."
 chi_dom.35.a: "Chairman Song wins reelection!"

 chi_dom.36.t: "Chen Mingshu Claims National Leadership"
 chi_dom.36.d: "Two times the Kuomintang have failed in establishing control over China, each time has been progressively worse. First, the KMT lost the Northern Expedition, then they failed to revolt... now it is our turn to secure China. With Chen Mingshu and the potential for other leaders of the KMT to remerge the future is bright. First, however, we must deal with the many problems that face Liangguang and then look outwards."
 chi_dom.36.a: "A Toast to Chen."

 chi_dom.37.t: "Song Qingling Arrives"
 chi_dom.37.d: "The infamous Song Qingling has arrived to make sure our KMT is seen as more legitimate to the rest of China and the world. With her in a position of power, we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
 chi_dom.37.a: "Welcome Back Song."

 chi_dom.38.t: "Wang Jingwei Arrives"
 chi_dom.38.d: "The Hero of the KMT, Wang Jingwei has also arrived to make sure the KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of China and the world. With his prominence in the politics of China, we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
 chi_dom.38.a: "A Toast to Wang."

 chi_dom.39.t: "Song and Chen Disagree"
 chi_dom.39.d: "Chen and Song whilst technically belonging to a similar ideological party have various differences which are seriously disrupting the re-establishment of the KMT. Chen believes that the revolution must include elements of Chen Jiongming's government if it is to truly survive whereas Song insists that the KMT should stay with the policies of the last two versions of the KMT. Whatever comes out of these talks it is clear one of the two will have to garner support to keep their position."
 chi_dom.39.a: "We can only hope they can solve their differences."

 chi_dom.40.t: "Unrest in Guangdong"
 chi_dom.40.d: "Whilst the political side of Chen's removal is solidly behind Chen... on paper, the peasants are rioting at the new change in government. Before when the KMT used Guangdong as a staging ground for the Northern Expedition at least Jiongming was around to placate them but without him, the stability of the province is deteriorating."
 chi_dom.40.a: "We must fix this."

 chi_dom.41.t: "Song and Chen Debate Further"
 chi_dom.41.d: "Chen and Song have been subtly critical of each other since the beginning however the two are now openly discussing who should be in charge of the Kuomintang. It seems the facade of unity has been chucked out of the window and the race to become leader has begun. The comfort we can take out of this is that the other agreed to not be a threat should one of them come out on top."
 chi_dom.41.a: "We will take what little good news we can get."

 chi_dom.42.t: "Unrest in Guangxi"
 chi_dom.42.d: "The warlords in Guangxi have finally been defeated however the remnants of their clique are causing trouble in the area. Whilst they are certainly without any meaningful leadership it is perhaps best to put them out of their misery."
 chi_dom.42.a: "They will be dealt with."

 chi_dom.43.t: "Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
 chi_dom.43.d: "The battle between Song and Chen seems to have distracted us from the larger issue, the huge refugee problem to the east. Under normal conditions this would be fine however the lack of control we have risks these peasants causing trouble, already some incidents have occurred at the border. We can only watch for the time being..."
 chi_dom.43.a: "This must be kept under control."

 chi_dom.44.t: "More Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
 chi_dom.44.d: "The huge refugee problem to the east has grown significantly. Double the number of refugees since the last report has made it into the province with some of these peasants causing more trouble than before, something must be done about this issue soon."
 chi_dom.44.a: "Something must be done!"

 chi_dom.45.t: "The Toughest Decision"
 chi_dom.45.d: "Chen has been troubled by these refugees as he feels it was our obligation to protect them during the Fujian Government however he has also recognised the issue that we face with the large influx of crime. He has a choice between trying to broker peace with the peasants or forcing them all back to the Fujian Zone."
 chi_dom.45.a: "They have only caused trouble."
 chi_dom.45.b: "We need to appeal to the populace here."

 chi_dom.46.t: "The Leadership Crisis has Begun"
 chi_dom.46.d: "Chen and Song are now going head to head to try and become leader of the Kuomintang. They will be trying to garner enough support from the party to be elected to the role of President which will have the duty of overseeing the foundation of a KMT China."
 chi_dom.46.a: "They have only caused trouble."

 chi_dom.47.t: "Chen Makes a Statement"
 chi_dom.47.d: "Chen Mingshu has finally spoken on the issue of his continued presidency, whilst he isn't fully the President of the Republic he has been overseeing the peaceful transition from Federalism. In his speech, Chen also mentions how he is dedicated to making the KMT rule China due to the fact he restored them."
 chi_dom.47.a: "He makes a good point!"

 chi_dom.48.t: "Song Qingling's Speech"
 chi_dom.48.d: "Song starts her speech by reminding people that she was married to Sun Yat-sen and that she was also dedicated to uniting China. She also says that this means she is committed to Sun Yat-sen's Policies and that she will realise his vision for China."
 chi_dom.48.a: "A good speech!"

 chi_dom.49.t: "Election Results Incoming"
 chi_dom.49.d: "On the eve of the election results we await the announcement of who will lead the Ktotoo greatness. People have been highly supportive of both due to each of their positions but at the end of the day, only one will make it on top. Despite their differences, Song walked up to Chen shaking his hands and wishing him 'Good Luck' which he reciprocated. This is most likely to show the unity of the government but some speculate they both genuinely respect each other part to play in China."
 chi_dom.49.a: "I just can't sleep."

 chi_dom.50.t: "The President Announced"
 chi_dom.50.d: "The results are in and with the fate of the KMT... and China in the hands of the result many are eager to hear who came out on top. People suggest Chen might have due to his determination to unite China whilst other people make a note that some party members look high upon Song due to her relationship with the Father of China, one thing for sure is that the winner is..."
 chi_dom.50.a: "Chen Mingshu!"
 chi_dom.50.b: "Song Qingling!"

 #### The First National Congress ####

 chi_cng.1.t: "Call to Convene The National Congress"
 chi_cng.1.d: "Having been ousted from the politics of China for more than a decade now, the Kuomintang's recent victory over its enemies in the League War has seen Sun Yat-sen's idea for a national revolution revived once more. Once the home of the Ming emperors, the Provisional Presidential Palace (which had been used as the seat of power for Sun Chunfang's autocratic rule over the Eight Provinces) - has now been renovated into the Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Government. News of the Kuomintang's First Repatriated Congress is beginning to spread across China, rallying like-minded revolutionaries, socialists, and leftists in a common goal to fulfil the dream of the Northern Expedition and create a modern and the just Republic of China.\n\nIn addition, a delegation from the Third Internationale will also be in attendance at the Congress. Having long pledged their support to the Kuomintang since the Party's initial reorganisation in 1924, the Central Committee has long played exile in Paris and, therefore, owes its remarkable success to the backing of the two major syndicalist nations of Europe. The cordial entourage includes the French syndicalist advisor Andre Malraux, the British advisor George Hardy, the Indian socialist M.N. Roy, the Dutch syndicalist Henk Sneevliet, and various volunteer advisors from the French and British militaries who have pledged their services to develop the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nChairman Wang Jingwei stood behind a grandiose portrait of Sun Yat-sen flanked by the Party's flag and the NRA's flag as he began his speech to inaugurate the Congress. Perhaps to acknowledge the absence of the Party's right wing, he started with a passionate appeal that, from a revolutionary anti-imperialist standpoint, the true revolutionaries were to come from the Left. And thus, the First Repatriated Congress began in earnest - the ecstatic revolutionary mood of Nanjing reminded many of the same patriotic fervour that had captured Guangzhou in 1924."
 chi_cng.1.a: "Well get on with it!"

 chi_cng.2.t: "KMT votes on adopting official history of the 1st Northern Expedition"
 chi_cng.2.d: "After much build up the National Revolutionary Army marched north against the Zhili in an effort to unify the country against the Zhili warlords... but this failed. Many points have been brought up such as the KMT lacking the people's support or intervention from foreign powers, specifically Germany. We should decide which of these arguments is more compelling to use as the root cause of the failure to unify the country."
 chi_cng.2.a: "Imperialists and traitors."
 chi_cng.2.b: "Lack of support from the population."

 chi_cng.3.t: "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
 chi_cng.3.d: "To outside observers, China is an ethnically homogenous nation. Indeed, the Chinese generally refer to themselves as "the people of the Han" - however, this can be a misnomer due to the fact that the Han are merely the largest ethnicity in China. The Zhuang, the Muslim Hui, the Manchus, the Uyghurs, the Yi, Tibetans, Mongols, Dong, Tuija, and many others make up the major and minor ethnicities that are spread out across all of the nation.\n\nEthnic relations within China have not always been peaceful. But it was the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen who theorised that the notion of minzu from the Three Principles of the People was necessary to prevent the nation from falling into disorder and chaos. Interestingly enough, his earlier opinions seemed to encourage the notion of a dominant Han ethnicity. But as evident from his declaration at the 1924 reorganisation of the Kuomintang, Sun proclaimed that the Kuomintang's anti-imperialist mission also included securing self-determination for all "domestic minzu." But the notion of minzu itself is disputed as Sun considers the great races of Qing China (aside from the Han majority), the Tibetans, Mongols, Manchus, and Hui, as mere relics of an ancient social structure.\n\nInstead, the late premier's stance was that the Minzu of China were all subordinate to the ethnically dominant "Hanzu" (Han ethnicity). It was, therefore, the more cultured and sophisticated Hanzu's destiny to lead the minzu into the evolutionary formation of a single Han Zhonghua Minzu. In the National Revolution, all notions of self-determination were to be suspended into the period of tutelage is passed as the country's minzu are merely inept to rule themselves.\n\nThe Repatriated Congress, in particular Wang Jingwei's faction, is mostly in favour of following Sun's principles. Nonetheless, the Provisional Action Committee has voiced openly that they would be more than happy to promise a degree of self-autonomy for the minorities, provided they support the KMT of course. While a Department of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs has been formed, the official doctrine of the said department is to train these peoples to adopt the revolutionary spirit of the superior Hanzu Kuomintang. But until the warlords and imperialists have been comprehensively defeated, the question of ethnic minorities shall remain indisputably answered by only the Kuomintang."
 chi_cng.3.a: "No. China must be truly unified."
 chi_cng.3.b: "Yes. It is the best way to reunify the country."

 chi_cng.4.t: "The Question of Syndicalist Parties"
 chi_cng.4.d: "The KMT's party programme for developing China plans that only the KMT will be allowed to exist as a full political party for the period of Political Tutelage and thus the sole political organ for the organisation of worker's unions - thus placing the Kuomintang's National Labour Union ahead of all other unions. As a precondition of Syndicalist aid, we have made exemptions for the Chinese Syndicalist Party and several other minor urban syndicalist groups. Should the Syndicalist parties be given an exception to the ban on public recruitment in the realm of organising urban labour?"
 chi_cng.4.a: "Yes, let us form a united front with the Chinese Syndicalist Party."
 chi_cng.4.b: "No, the National Labour Union allows us to monitor and control the growth of the CSP."

 chi_cng.5.t: "Status of Whampoa Academy"
 chi_cng.5.d: "Throughout the country, the average soldier lacks either the ideological motivation to fight for the ideas of revolution or a genuine lack of training and experience. With his own experiences of being betrayed by warlords such as Chen Jiongming, Sun Yat-sen sought to create an army loyal to the revolution and the party, one that would not deviate from the Three Principles of the People - with one heart and one morality. And thus, on the island of Changzhou, also known as Whampoa, the Whampoa Military Academy was born.\n\nOn June 16th, 1924, the first class of Whampoa was inaugurated with Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai as the representative of the Kuomintang, and the rising star Chiang Kai-shek as the headmaster of the academy. Class after class, Whampoa produced capable and intelligent officers - trained with modern weapons from Europe and underneath European officers such as the Bolshevik exile Vasily Blyhuker. Yet within those halls where comrades bathed and slept together, cliques and factions began to grow, especially as the school welcomed those from the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nThe defeat of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927 led to the seeming end of the short-lived school, but with the National, Revolutionary government revived - the Central Committee placed immediate efforts to restore the Whampoa Military Academy in preparation for the NRA's inevitable Northern Expedition. Leading the academy as its new headmaster will be Li Jishen, the veteran of the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone, while a host of new political instructors trained overseas will also be present such as He Zhonghan and Hu Zongnan. In charge of the political department will be the rising star Zhou Enlai, who has made a name for himself in the guerrilla zone. The Committee has also approved the Third Internationale military mission to stay in China and aid the revolution by participating as instructors and advisors to the newly rebuilt NRA."
 chi_cng.5.a: "Long live the NRA!"

 chi_cng.6.t: "Direction of the NRA"
 chi_cng.6.d: "Before and during the League War, the National Revolutionary Army adopted guerrilla warfare as its central operation doctrine. In fact, this switch had also broken the Leftist Kuomintang from the right wing of the NRA. In the Jiangsu Insurgent Zone, the Kuomintang guerrillas mastered the art of encirclements, speed, and surprise. But with the right-wing returning to the united front, the question is on how best to organise the NRA.\n\nThe switch to guerrilla warfare was merely a form of survival for the Nationalist movement. As Nationalist territory extends across the Eastern Coast of China, there is no longer a need to fight purely on the defensive. As such, the inevitable switch from unconventional warfare to conventional warfare has begun. However, within the NRA's strategic planning - a debate has arisen among its forces on which style of doctrine the NRA should adopt.\n\nVeterans of the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone such as Deng Yanda, Lin Biao, and Xu Xiangquan have argued that the unconventional means of the NRA's previous guerrilla war will suit the NRA's needs better. To defeat the much larger Qing and Fengtian armies will require the element of speed and encirclements of large forces akin to the guerrilla war fought in the insurgent zone. They have encouraged the doctrine of mass mobilisation to develop the notion that the war to unify China will be for the People - a People's War.\n\nHowever, proponents of army modernisation have suggested that the NRA adopt the centralised command found in the Union of Britain and Commune of France. This will rely on modern methods of communication such as radios and a highly structured command structure to focus on meticulous planning and strikes to coordinate the expedition against the warlords. The generals of the CRS and the Kuomintang's right wing are strong proponents of modernisation, citing that China's lack of modern standards is what needs to be reformed if China is to be strong once more."
 chi_cng.6.a: "Modernisation is key to unifying China."
 chi_cng.6.b: "Our old ways are best to unify China."

 chi_cng.7.t: "Establish the Propaganda Department"
 chi_cng.7.d: "What does the Kuomintang stand for? Why die for the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth? These questions must be answered for the average recruit of the National Revolutionary Army, as the average soldier in a Chinese army lacks ideological motivation and conviction. In preparation for the wars ahead, the Whampoa Military Academy has created the Propaganda Department to disseminate propaganda to the masses and to educate the soldiers of the NRA. \n\nThe Propaganda Department's uses will not just be limited to the wars of unification. The people of China must be educated in the ideals of the Three Principles of the People in order to ensure equality and liberty throughout the land. With the creation of the Propaganda Department, Inspired by M.N Roy and George Hardy - the syndicalist advisors have argued that the political department is to be the greatest political organ of the Party.\n\nThe Propaganda Department is to create a political newspaper named "The Political Weekly" and prepare the training of political commissars to ensure the ideological motivation and excellence of NRA soldiers. To administer this new important role, the Central Committee has proposed two candidates to serve as the head of the political department."
 chi_cng.7.a: "The talented general Deng Yanda!"
 chi_cng.7.b: "The returnee from Europe, Zhou Enlai!"

 chi_cng.8.t: "Report on the JiangFu Government"
 chi_cng.8.d: "Song Qingling has been the acting governor of Fujian province and the JiangFu zone for much of the last ten years. Her administration has, through creating a form of locally-run one-party democracy, created an alternative vision for how the National Revolution can be done that opposes the top-down nature of the Wang Jingwei programme. Members of Wang Jingwei's Reorganised Comrades Association criticise the idea of the JiangFu programme being expanded to all of China as being impractical, but its implementation has proven economically and militarily successful and very popular with Fujian province locals."
 chi_cng.8.a: "Adopt a token resolution praising Song's administration."
 chi_cng.8.b: "Officially recognise the JiangFu experiment as a success."

 chi_cng.9.t: "Review of the War of Five Provinces"
 chi_cng.9.d: "A review of the current status of the National Liberation Zone and its recent expansion out of JiangFu after the last campaign has been drafted by the NRA. The consensus of all involved advises caution in moving north against the Zhili too soon. A majority of the NRA's old guard favours focusing on reunifying southern China before daring to cross the Huai, but the Young Guard and their allies in the Zhongteju such as He Zhonghan advise an opportunistic stance towards an inevitable war between the Zhili clique and itself or Fengtian."
 chi_cng.9.a: "Favour regional unification."
 chi_cng.9.b: "Favour opportunism in the north."

 chi_cng.10.t: "Election of the new KMT Central Committee"
 chi_cng.10.d1: "After the series of debates during the Congress, Wang Jingwei has secured his control over the Kuomintang and will now serve as the leader of the republic. He will begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
 chi_cng.10.d2: "After the series of debates during the Congress, Song Qingling's faction has denounced the Reorganised Comrades Association of the Kuomintang as being nothing more than syndicalist sympathisers who pose a dangerous threat due to their connections with the Third Internationale. In an outstanding vote of no confidence, Wang Jingwei has been removed from the National Revolutionary Government's leadership, as Song Qingling's Provisional Action Committee takes over. Wang has decided to graciously accept a post as the Kuomintang's official foreign ambassador to France where he will be joined by his friends and his closest followers. We shall begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
 chi_cng.10.a: "Chairman Wang's policy is always right."
 chi_cng.10.b: "Song's faction will bring new energy to the Committee."

 ###Second National Congress
 chi_cng.11.t: "Call to Convene The Second National Congress"
 chi_cng.11.d: "Once more, in the headquarters of the National Revolutionary Government in [CHI.Capital.GetName] the calls to convene a Congress have been spread out throughout the country. As the country is largely under Kuomintang control, with Beijing under the flag of the Republic of China, outside observers regard this  Congress as a jubilant celebration of the success of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision. Sun's remains were transferred to the capital of the National Revolutionary Government as well - having been in Beijing since his untimely death in 1925.\n\nThe topics of this new discussion will cover aspects of the National Reconstruction as well as the class base of the Kuomintang Organisation. Furthermore, the battle-tested National Revolutionary Army is set to be reorganised under the new central government. Once more, foreign advisors from the syndicalist nations are also present - a sight that has led to rumours of worry amongst some. Beyond the Great Wall, there is still the ever-present threat of the Fengtian Clique and their imperialist Japanese backers, who will no doubt seek to destabilise the newly formed Republic."
 chi_cng.11.a: "We better get started fast."

 chi_cng.12.t: "The Fate of Puyi"
 chi_cng.12.d: "When he was deposed as a child in 1912 and put into de facto house arrest in the Forbidden City, few thought Puyi would ever be a threat. After all, the monarchy was deeply unpopular and the fledging Republic had far more pressing problems to deal with than a hapless toddler. But alas, strongmen came and went starting with Yuan Shikai, and many ignorantly attempted to hoist a monarchy onto the people. The Germans, in all their arrogance, insisted on restoring Puyi to his so-called "birthright", as if the snuffing out of the Xinhai dream could be any more complete.\n\nBut the republican dream of freedom did not die with the end of the Northern Expedition. And now, with our Republic at least restored across China there leaves one final matter to attend to as we turn the page in China's story. Puyi has grown into a vile, wicked man - taught little practical skills and a sadistic, childish personality. Or so our propaganda says. The reality is the man has been a puppet his entire life, and [CHI.GetLeader] has already ruled out a public execution of the deposed Emperor as excessive. There is little for our government to gain besides unneeded comparisons to Lenin. So there remain a few options.\n\nThe first would be to simply exile him to whichever state is willing to take him in. While this would effectively wash our government's hands of this matter, some question if this would pose a major security risk. Another possibility is to order him confined in the Forbidden City under house arrest, keeping him out of sight until he dies forgotten. Many however feel this is too similar to the unpopular articles written after Puyi's first abdication, and also allows for the effective embodiment of reactionary evil to go unpunished for his treasonous deeds. The final, and perhaps most radical proposal, would be to attempt to rehabilitate Puyi. This would entail a substantive effort to retrain the man to live like his fellow citizens as another comrade in a larger revolution."
 chi_cng.12.a: "Send him to exile."
 chi_cng.12.b: "Place him under house arrest in his own palace."
 chi_cng.12.c: "Let us show him the true glories of socialism."

 chi_cng.13.t: "Adopting a National Anthem"
 chi_cng.13.d: "With the unification of China proper under the sword and flag of the Kuomintang, efforts have been made to consolidate Nationalist rule with a proper Chinese anthem. While some radical socialists within the government have proposed the Internationale (translated in vernacular Chinese by the syndicalist in exile Qu Qiubai), this move has attracted backlash from members of the Central Committee who believe that the lyrics of the National Anthem must reflect the principles held dear by our late premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen. As such, many are in favour of adopting Professor Cheng Maoyun's "Three Principles of the People" - which traces its lyrics to a speech Sun Yat-sen gave in 1924. Alternatively, a suggestion has arisen from the Chinese musician Huang Tzu - with lyrics taken from a poem written by the prominent right-wing Kuomintang ideologue Dai Jitao. While not as popular as the other two options, the song has also been suggested to be played at the raising and lowering of the national flag."
 chi_cng.13.a: "The Three Principles of the People, of course."
 chi_cng.13.b: "The Yingtenaixiongnaier!"
 chi_cng.13.c: "The Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth"

 chi_cng.14.t: "Military Reconstruction"
 chi_cng.14.d: "Confronted with the colossal task of national reconstruction, one of the tasks at the Repatriated National Congress is to reduce and reorganise the national army. Bloated by captured stockpiles and defectors from the former Beijing government, the NRA is a mess.\n\nA National Disbandment Commission was established with nearly all the military leaders in attendance. The posts of commander-in-chief, field commanders, and other wartime tactical roles were abolished, and efforts were initiated to disband all superfluous troops. The Commission included the standardisation of the now battle-hardened National Revolutionary Army divisions into two types.\n\n These types are the: A type: 2 Infantry brigades, 1 Cavalry, 1 Artillery battalion, 1 Engineer battalion, Signal Company, 1 Transport battalion, and 1 Special Service Company - and B type: 3 Infantry brigades along with the rest of the A-type division.\n\nUntil the arrival of the Nationalist Party, those in the army were only instructed to follow the desires of the corrupt and greedy warlords. The modern and reformed National Revolutionary Army challenged these notions of a corrupt army, displaying the strength and zeal of a liberating army on the battlefield. Truly it is indeed an army fit to carry out Dr. Sun's vision for a modern China!"
 chi_cng.14.a: "Wansui to the NRA!"

 chi_cng.15.t: "The Issue of the National Language"
 chi_cng.15.d: "As Congress drags on, one of the main questions to answer is that of language. Nearly 300 million native speakers of its northern dialect of Mandarin in China. In the South, there are 37 million who speak Wu (the dialect of Zhejiang), 22 million speak Cantonese, 20 million speak Hakka, and several million speak the Fujian dialect. During the wars of unification, there were undoubtedly incidents in which language unfamiliarity led to chaos within the armed forces and across the country.\n\nWhile the Northern Chinese dialect of Mandarin continues to dominate use in the official language of the government, there is an emerging argument between those who insist that mandarin be standardised and used for cultural, official, and educational purposes. There are those who support the cultural protection of China's many languages. Proponents of radical language reform, especially among radical socialists, argue that the character system must be simplified to promote mass literacy across the country. However, they are opposed by more traditionalists within the Kuomintang. They argue that this extensive language simplification will strip characters and words of their original meaning and cultural sophistication.\n\nA compromise is reached, however, with the Ministry of Education first publishing a list of  "Guoyin Common Vocabulary." which includes popular simplified characters and determines the standard phonetic system. Furthermore, it has also proposed the creation of a committee on the Unification of National Languages to organise simplified characters already in circulation as standard characters. However, this is far from radical character reform and does not seek to change many existing characters in the Chinese hanzi."
 chi_cng.15.a: "We will certainly put some thought into this."

 chi_cng.16.t: "Health Reconstruction"
 chi_cng.16.d: "As the country begins to rebuild from the years of neglect by the warlord, the time has come to modernise the country's medical institutions. Improving public health is seen as fulfilling one of Dr. Sun's dreams for the country, as physically strong people cannot be conquered or face national extinction. These ideas of Social Darwinism are popular amongst intellectuals in the Kuomintang, who see China as a country in danger.\n\nAkin to the NCERA, the Kuomintang has supported a proposal of seven campaigns to help local self-government prosper, one of which involves public health. The National Government has approved the creation of a socialised health administration that hopes to provide government-funded welfare and medicare for the peasantry, who normally cannot afford or access medicinal treatment. While this plan is certainly good on paper, a country the sheer size of China and one that lacks a highly trained medical professional class may indicate that such a plan will not be effective in its initial days.\n\nThe newly created Ministry of Health has proposed the creation of a national health service and establishing demonstration centers under the government's sponsorship. The Ministry will invite foreign medical advisors to advise and train Chinese medical professionals. The Ministry will then create a Central Field Health Station in the nation's capital as the technical headquarters for public health work, eventually growing into a national health service.\n\nAt the local level, the Ministry has created "Demonstration Centers" such as the Tangshan Rural Health Station. These clinics are staffed by a single doctor and two nurses and hope to provide clinical treatments at the local village level and sanitation. Vaccination campaigns against common diseases such as smallpox raise the local population's health consciousness. Furthermore, there have been proposals to establish rural welfare centres to operate in the former Jiangfu region to increase popular support, aid vaccinations, provide medical treatments, and encourage sanitary practices in the rural regions."
 chi_cng.16.a: "Sounds good!"

 chi_cng.17.t: "National Financial Reform"
 chi_cng.17.d: "The Kuomintang has pursued a heavily leftist direction since the end of the Northern Expedition, and thus, many of its factions profess the ideals of socialism. However, the end goal of socialism cannot be reached by the current state of the Chinese economy. As such, the Repatriated Congress has approved the Chinese Finance Development Commission (CFDC) to develop state-controlled private enterprises and capital to generate the development of an eventual socialist economy.\n\nLed by the brother of Song Qingling, Song Ziwen - the CFDC, from the eyes of the Third Internationale, would appear to be nothing more than capitalism. Indeed it is an investment company created by the Ministry of Finance to sponsor the growth of railways, infrastructures, and capital with the eventual goal of helping China transition strictly into a socialist economy.  The CFDC will also be led by Li Shizeng, one of the Four Elders of the KMT.\n\nThe ideas of state capitalism are supported generally by both major factions of the Kuomintang. Chen Gongbo has expressed his interest in the movement but is more radical in his stance that the Kuomintang should also proceed to nationalise foreign trade. Chen also argues that chartered private companies should aid in rural areas to promote the development of rural agricultural cooperatives to enhance China's agrarian output. He has dismissed criticisms of his ideas as supporting capitalism by arguing that the Kuomintang's efforts as a vanguard party will constrict economic growth from becoming that of monopoly capitalism."
 chi_cng.17.a: "It's not capitalism when we do it!"

 chi_cng.18.t: "Determining the class base of the Kuomintang"
 chi_cng.18.d: "In its original state in Guangzhou, the Kuomintang was a "big-tent" party - a party made up of not just left-wing revolutionaries but also those of more conservative stances who opposed the KMT's relationship with the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Third Internationale. Therefore, one of the key questions at this first Repatriated Congress is the issue of what does the Kuomintang represent? Who shall make up the members of this revolutionary movement to fulfil the dream of the late Dr. Sun after all?\n\nSince the break with the KMT's right-wing following the disaster of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang has made an explicit direction toward the Left. While the party elders, such as Wu Zhihui, argue that the Party is for everyone who isn't a warlord - the majority of the Central Committee has declared that the Kuomintang henceforth shall only represent the Chinese workers, peasants, and petite bourgeoisie. Citing the 1925 Canton-Hong Kong strikes - the official party stance acknowledges the existence of a class struggle within Chinese society.\n\nUnlike the Chinese Syndicalist Party, while the Kuomintang believes that the workers are at the forefront of the revolution - it does not believe that they are a big enough force. The party's mass movement and class base are drawn by the peasantry and petite bourgeoisie (handicraft shop owners, intellectuals, students, and small merchants). While the entire party hasn't agreed on the idea of class struggle, the declaration of a class base will alienate the Right-Kuomintang from the Left further."
 chi_cng.18.a: "Their chains will be broken!"

 chi_cng.19.t: "End of the Congress"
 chi_cng.19.d: "With its concluding and final remarks, the Second Repatriated Congress ended in a resounding success. Nonetheless, the National Revolution remains unfinished. The imperialist threat in China has not been dealt with, and it will be long before the Kuomintang can declare that the complete Chinese Revolution has been successful.  From the humble origins in European exile and the Jiangfu insurgency, the Kuomintang has indeed come far.\n\nWhile many assumed it to be on the agenda, the issue of the Five Power Constitution and a decision to end political tutelage has yet to be fully determined. While some delegates expressed favour for extending democracy to the masses, many have agreed that the time is not yet suitable for such an implementation. The Kuomintang shall now rule as the sole party in fulfilling the national revolution."
 chi_cng.19.a: "Zhonghua Minguo Wansui!"

 chi_for.3.t: "A Provisional Capital in Nanjing?"
 chi_for.3.d: "With the conquest of Jiangsu from the remnants of the Southern Zhili, we have secured the great prize of Nanjing. The city is the historical capital of several dynasties, was the centre of the League of Eight Provinces, and the favoured permanent capital of many in the KMT. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanjing until our final capital is determined."

Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanchang until our final capital is determined."

 chi_for.6.t: "Wave of KMT Sabotage Activities"
 chi_for.6.d: "A series of explosions in [ROOT.GetName] army depots and sabotaged railway lines have disrupted our military capabilities. These partisan activities are reportedly the work of Kuomintang operatives working inside our territory, but so far our security officers have only apprehended individual agents. Disturbingly enough, these attacks are only focused on troops and resources intended for our struggle against [CHI.GetNameDef], indicating that they have a high level of intelligence about our army's daily movements.\n\nFrontline reports indicate that the Kuomintang is planning to initiate a major offensive against us."

Having received military and economic support from the sympathetic Chinese Kuomintang, the leftist faction of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea appears to dominate the political scene of the newly independent revolutionary Korea.\nThe leftist faction of the PGROK led by Kim Wonbong, a Korean revolutionary in exile and Whampoa graduate, has been stationed in Shanghai since 1935. His faction, the so-called Korean National Revolutionary Party shares many political values and facets with the Chinese Kuomintang and has essentially acted as its sister party within the potential Korean state. Now with the Chinese victory over the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wonbong has officially handed his resignation as a general of the National Revolutionary Army to oversee and administer the newly liberated Republic of Korea."

Nonetheless, despite [CHI.GetLeader]'s declaration for the Republic of China's open neutrality in the greater European war, he has promised us aid to pay the Internationale back for years of assistance and training. When the Kuomintang lost the First Northern Expedition, we allowed their Central Committee to reside safely in the [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef]. Not only did we provide the Kuomintang with asylum, but we also provided them with valuable military equipment and training so that they may bring the revolution to their country.\n\nThe Republic of China's aid has come to us today with thousands of Chinese labourers arriving on our shores - ready to aid the world revolution by doing their part. While we would rather prefer the military strength of China on our side, we understand that the Chinese will take some time to recover from years of warfare and corruption. Thus, we graciously accept the aid the Republic of China sent us."

 chi_fng.18.d: "The Fengtian Government, after a request by our government, has outrightly refused to hand over the land previously agreed to. If we are to make the most out of this power vacuum we must attack them immediately otherwise"
 chi_fng.18.a: "Of course they did..."
 chi_fng.18.b: "They can play Central Government for now..."

 chi_fng.19.t: "Uniting the Country"
 chi_fng.19.d: "The time has come to begin the process of uniting China under the Kuomintang. The only hurdle in our goal is the Fengtian Government... we should consider holding a second batch of negotiations to bring Zhang in line."
 chi_fng.19.a: "We must unite the nation."

 chi_fng.20.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Offers us a Chance to Unite the Country"
 chi_fng.20.d: "The Kuomintang has recently contacted one of our delegates with what they claim is a chance to unite the nation. With the Republic of China proclaimed, it was just a matter of time before a demand such as this was coming our way, How should we respond?"
 chi_fng.20.a: "We will enter talks"
 chi_fng.20.b: "They want to depose Marshal Zhang!"

 chi_fng.21.t: "Fengtian refuses to continue"
 chi_fng.21.d: "The fools in Fengtian are refusing to continue with our negotiations with Zhang citing that we are a threat to the old Beiyang Republican ideals. We are left with no other choice."
 chi_fng.21.a: "We will unite the country through force!"

 chi_fng.22.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Meet"
 chi_fng.22.d: "The Fengtian government has agreed to meet and begin unification negotiations. This might present the possibility of a peaceful unification which was certainly not what our government had predicted."
 chi_fng.22.a: "Excellent!"

 chi_fng.23.t: "Bring up the Unification Proposal"
 chi_fng.23.d: "The Fengtian delegates have arrived and talks have already commenced. We must propose full unification with Fengtian officially being integrated into the Republic. The chances of Zhang accepting are perhaps minimal but it is worth a try."
 chi_fng.23.a: "Perhaps we stand a chance?"

 chi_fng.24.t: "Beijing offers unification"
 chi_fng.24.d: "The Kuomintang delegates have requested unification but have graciously offered us limited autonomy under a Kuomintang-ruled China. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng.24.a: "Offer them our loyalty in return for support and autonomy"
 chi_fng.24.b: "Refuse"

 chi_fng.25.t: "Fengtian agrees, With a price"
 chi_fng.25.d: "As the glorious banner of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth flies over the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, the conference between representatives of the Fengtian Clique and the Nationalist government ended in success. The Fengtian Clique has agreed to become a subordinate clique of the Nationalist Government, guaranteeing the loyalty (in name only) of the Northwest for now while promising that the Clique remains autonomous for now of the newly proclaimed Kuomintang government.\n\n[FNG.GetLeader] declared to his army this morning that all flags of the Fengtian Clique be replaced with the banners of the Kuomintang and National Revolutionary Army. By this symbolic gesture, [FNG.GetLeader] has shown to all of China that the country shall henceforth be symbolically united. However, the unification will surely not be met well by the Empire of Japan, which has long sought to divide and exploit our glorious country through their pervasive influence of Mantetsu. The unification with the Northwest will be our bulwark in the defence of the motherland, they shall come for us but they will surely fail."
 chi_fng.25.a: "We have finally united the country!"

 chi_fng.26.t: "The North-east is Ours"
 chi_fng.26.d: "The Fengtian government having agreed to our proposal has yielded and allowed our troops to march into the Fengtian region. The North-East region has been secured for the Kuomintang."
 chi_fng.26.a: "A historic day for China!"

 chi_fng.27.t: "Marshal Zhang steps down"
 chi_fng.27.d: "Following the agreement with the Kuomintang, Marshal Zhang has decided to step down thing morning. This comes as a shock to many and his legacy, while taunted, will always be remembered."
 chi_fng.27.a: "Long live Xueliang."

 chi_fng.28.t: "Fengtian Falls"
 chi_fng.28.d: "We have just received news that the Fengtian government has completely given in to the Kuomintang. This is a direct threat to our national security as well as our interests in Asia. The Kuomintang now controls the Fengtian region."
 chi_fng.28.a: "We can't do anything..."
 chi_fng.28.b: "This means war!"

 chi_fng_war.1.t: "An offer from the Kuomintang"
 chi_fng_war.1.d: "We have just received an offer from the Kuomintang. They say, that if we join them in their struggle against the Fengtian Government, they will grant us control over Eastern Shanxi. We could, however, reject this offer and see what Marshal Zhang might have to offer us..."
 chi_fng_war.1.a: "Tell them we accept."
 chi_fng_war.1.b: "Let's contact Fengtian for a counteroffer."
 chi_fng_war.1.c: "We are a neutral clique for a reason, we refuse."

 chi_fng_war.2.t: "Shanxi refuses to join us"
 chi_fng_war.2.d: "Stating that their neutrality shall not be challenged, The Shanxi government has refused to join us in our struggle against the Fengtian government."
 chi_fng_war.2.a: "At least they didn't join Marshal Zhang."

 chi_fng_war.3.t: "Shanxi accepts our offer"
 chi_fng_war.3.d: "This morning, we received word that Shanxi has agreed to our offer to attack Fengtian. Hopefully, we can rely on Yan to join the war but we should always be cautious as his opportunism has no bounds."
 chi_fng_war.3.a: "They have chosen well."

 chi_fng_war.5.t: "Shanxi proposes an offer"
 chi_fng_war.5.d: "In a recent message, the government of Shanxi has proposed a deal to us. They say that they will join us in our struggle against the Kuomintang, so long as they give us control of Eastern Shanxi. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng_war.5.a: "Yan has placed his faith in the right person, we accept."
 chi_fng_war.5.b: "We won't give away our vital land."

 chi_fng_war.6.t: "Fengtian accepts"
 chi_fng_war.6.d: "We have just received word that Marshal Zhang has agreed to our offer and will be expecting our attack within a short period of time. Let us hope that they don't fail us."
 chi_fng_war.6.a: "We are betting a lot on you Zhang."

 chi_fng_war.7.t: "Time to strike!"
 chi_fng_war.7.d: "Our troops have been deployed to the border and the time has come to begin our intervention and reclaim the eastern parts of our province for the good of the people. Let us hope we've picked the right side..."
 chi_fng_war.7.a: "This should be quite a surprise."

 chi_fng_war.8.t: "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"
 chi_fng_war.8.d: "While giving Yan Eastern Shanxi was a core part of our deal with their government, there is much debate on if we should follow our promises. If we refuse to give up Eastern Shanxi, we will most certainly have another conflict to deal with."
 chi_fng_war.8.a: "We will honour the deal with Yan, but he will have to submit."
 chi_fng_war.8.b: "He is a rebel and will be treated like one."

 chi_fng_war.9.t: "The Kuomintang returns Eastern Shanxi, for a price."
 chi_fng_war.9.d: "The Kuomintang has agreed to follow through with our previous agreement. However, they have demanded that we submit to their authority and join their government. What should we do?"
 chi_fng_war.9.a: "The Kuomintang are one step ahead of us."
 chi_fng_war.9.b: "We will bend to no traitors."

 chi_fng_war.10.t: "The Kuomintang refuse to give up land"
 chi_fng_war.10.d: "The government of the Kuomintang has blatantly refused to return our land to us after we made a pact to help them, this betrayal has shown us that no central government can be trusted. It appears we made the wrong friends..."
 chi_fng_war.10.a: "Why did we trust them!"

 chi_fng_war.11.t: "Shanxi has joined our government"
 chi_fng_war.11.d: "Shanxi has caved to our demands and has joined us. With the region under our firm control, we can look further west to secure any remaining warlords that have eluded us so far. We are one step closer to uniting China under one banner."
 chi_fng_war.11.a: "China is nearly whole again!"

 chi_fng_war.12.t: "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"
 chi_fng_war.12.d: "While giving Yan Eastern Shanxi was a core part of our deal with their government, there is much debate on if we should follow our promises. If we refuse to give up Eastern Shanxi, we will most certainly have another conflict to deal with."

 chi_fng_war.12.b: "He is a rebel and will be treated like one."

 chi_fng_war.13.t: "Eastern Shanxi is ours again"
 chi_fng_war.13.d: "The Fengtian government has returned Eastern Shanxi as promised, Yan was right to place his cards on Zhang as he is true to his word. With Shanxi and Shaanxi fully under our control, we can now truly focus on developing a Model Province."
 chi_fng_war.13.a: "Marshal Zhang is but a part of the machine that is China."

 chi_fng_war.14.t: "Marshal Zhang refuses to give up land"
 chi_fng_war.14.d: "The Fengtian government has blatantly refused to return our land to us after we made a pact to help them, this betrayal has shown us that no central government can be trusted. It appears we made the wrong friends..."

 chi_fng_war.15.t: "Kuomintang incurs past the southern border"
 chi_fng_war.15.d: "We have just received a report from our military garrisons on our border with the Kuomintang. It appears that the Kuomintang has made an incursion past their sector onto our side of the border. This lasted for only a short while until the unit seemingly realised their mistake and quickly returned to their side."
 chi_fng_war.15.a: "How odd..."

 chi_fng_war.16.t: "Kuomintang incursions increase"
 chi_fng_war.16.d: "According to our military command, we have received multiple reports of Kuomintang incursions past their sector of the border. At least six incursions were reported to have happened in different locations across our southern border. We have replied by increasing our garrisons to make sure the syndicalists stay on their side of the border. We should be wary."
 chi_fng_war.16.a: "Are they planning an invasion?"

 chi_fng_war.17.t: "Locals found attacking pro-Kuomintang officials"
 chi_fng_war.17.d: "This morning, we have received word that the people of several border towns seen violently attacking pro-Kuomintang officials in their area. There have been reports of arson and at least three people have been killed."
 chi_fng_war.17.a: "Troubling."

 chi_fng_war.18.t: "Beiyang official killed!"
 chi_fng_war.18.d: "The news of a Beiyang official's death has spread quickly throughout the government. After failing to show up to a conference, he was found dead in his kitchen. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, many in the government are growing increasingly paranoid."
 chi_fng_war.18.a: "A Kuomintang assassin perhaps?"

 chi_fng_war.19.t: "The Red Scare spreading unrest throughout the north"
 chi_fng_war.19.d: "Many protests started seemingly overnight as people took to the streets to burn red flags and chant 'Death to the Reds' and 'Save our Families'. The stories are well known. The people are no fools and are aware of what has been happening. Every day, stories come in from our southern border. Mass executions, confiscation of land, families murdered. The people have seen what these bloodthirsty syndicalists have done to the land and will never allow such a thing to happen here."
 chi_fng_war.19.a: "Something needs to be done before this gets out of hand."

 chi_fng_war.20.t: "Explosion in Beijing"
 chi_fng_war.20.d: "It has just been reported that there has been a massive explosion at an industrial plant in Beijing. It happened seemingly out of nowhere and when authorities arrived at the scene, the building was completely destroyed. At this moment, the death toll appears to be around thirty-four. An investigation is being held to find out who was behind this, but as of now, the people are frightened."
 chi_fng_war.20.a: "This has to be the work of the Kuomintang."

 chi_fng_war.21.t: "The Marshal's decision"
 chi_fng_war.21.d: "After learning of the explosion, Marshal Zhang ordered a meeting of his highest generals and staff to discuss possible actions. As of now, there is much evidence that the Kuomintang was behind the attack. This, in every definition, is a declaration of war by the Kuomintang. What does Marshal Zhang decide to do?"
 chi_fng_war.21.a: "The Kuomintang behind this, they must pay!"
 chi_fng_war.21.b: "This is just fear-mongering, send the military down to quell the unrest."

 chi_fng_war.22.t: "Fengtian issue a declaration of war"
 chi_fng_war.22.d: "This evening, the Fengtian government issued us a formal declaration of war. In the declaration, they claimed that after multiple border incursions, the murder of Fengtian officials, and the aiding of terrorism, they have no other choice but to issue a declaration of war."
 chi_fng_war.22.a: "They have made a grave mistake..."

### Foreign Policy ####
 chi_faction.1.t: "Future Direction of the National Revolution"
 chi_faction_song.d: "The Chinese National Revolution has succeeded on the mainland, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has begun its outstanding efforts to integrate remaining dissenters into the newly proclaimed Republic of China.\n\nSong Qingling, in her recently self-published collection of writings, "The Struggle for a New China," has dedicated the book not only to the Chinese National Party but also to the oppressed masses throughout Asia and the world. She argues that with her vast natural resources and glorious revolutionary potential, China must aid and prepare the rest of colonised nations for decolonisation. The Chinese National Revolution is not merely a Chinese revolution; it shall be a template for future revolutions to learn and adopt from. The remarkableness and resilience of the revolution's survival despite constant failures shall be lessons to know for the people of the Philippines, Malaysia, Korea, and beyond.\n\nThus, the Chinese government today announced the "Sino-Pacific Friendship Association" - formally declaring China's return to the world stage."

 chi_faction_song.a: "United in Anti-Imperialism!"

 chi_faction_wang.d: "Within Wang Jingwei's Reorganised Comrades Association-dominated Central Committee, few expected the Kuomintang to return from near destruction in triumphant exile to the Chinese mainland. Since their party's exile in the Commune of France and the Union of Britain, the RCA nonetheless has proven itself as a capable faction in leading the national revolution.\n\nChen Gongbo, in his writings on the direction of the Chinese Revolution after the national unification, has written extensively on China's role in the greater world struggle against imperialism. For it is China, the unified nationalist state that was far more prepared and ready than any other colonial country in the East to lead the greater struggle for freedom. China is, after all, the most critical market in the East, and other colonial countries in the East were merely secondary in importance compared to China's lucrative markets and resources. Furthermore, the fact that the Chinese were able to complete the national unification proves that imperialism could be kneeled by the revolutionary dadao.\n\nIn addition, the economic situation and history of the oppressed peoples were similar to China's. They should not adopt the capitalist and syndicalist systems but rather the "People's Livelihood" systems expressed by the Kuomintang. Advocates of Chinese internationalism, such as Chen Gongbo, argue that 1/5th of the world is ethnically Chinese and that the oppressed people of the East are under the influence of Chinese culture. Therefore, it is the revolution's natural course to usher in a new era of anti-imperialism with China as the headquarters of a new global international revolution!"

 chi_faction_wang.a: "The Asian Internationale Unites the Asian Race!"

 chi_faction_totalist.d: "While the China Reconstruction Society's rise to power may have originated from the shadows, they have nonetheless proved capable of leading the national revolution. As CRS death squads patrol the streets of China to infiltrate and destroy dissenting domestic elements, the time has come to determine the course of the National Revolution.\n\nSome members of the CRS believe that China's destiny is to demonstrate her sovereignty and power across Asia. After all, China was the premier power of the East for centuries. None could match China in her cultural brilliance, as clearly evident from the East and Southeast Asian nations that attempt to mimic Chinese culture, writing, and society. But she has fallen prey to the imperialist powers and is subjected to constant humiliation. Only by reasserting Chinese power throughout Asia would we be able to liberate the nations of the East under the guidance of the Chinese revolution. As Sun himself believed, weak societies do not survive in this world.\n\nThere are also many who believe that China should turn away from the foreign politics of the West. While there should undoubtedly be nations that fall subject to China's influence, it is better to focus on internal issues and to look towards China first rather than participate on the world stage."

 chi_faction_totalist.a: "China, revived and stronger than before!"
 chi_faction_totalist.b: "China first!"

 chi_faction.2.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Proposes a Joint Attack on Japan"
 chi_faction.2.d: "While relations between the former United States and the Chinese people have been mixed, given the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act as well as the unequal treaties, a recent development has occurred in both of our nations that may lead to a fruitful and productive relationship. The Chinese National Revolution succeeded with the victory of the Kuomintang, and a new socialist regime arrived in China, bent on restoring China's sovereignty from imperialism and achieving equality for the Chinese peasants and workers.\n\nA Chinese delegation arrived in [CSA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today to discuss the threat of the Japanese Empire to the security and sovereignty of the Asian nations. Led by Zhou Enlai and Sun Fo (the son of Dr. Sun Yat-sen), the delegation met with [CSA.GetLeader] and has proposed a joint Sino-American pact of non-aggression as well as a joint attack on the Empire of Japan."
 chi_faction.2.a: "A toast to our new friends in China"
 chi_faction.2.b: "We appreciate the offer but humbly decline."

 chi_faction.3.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Accepts"
 chi_faction.3.d: "The negotiations between our two countries have been successful today in [CSA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the Chinese and American diplomats signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty - promising not to declare war on one another and to prepare a joint attack on the Empire of Japan in the coming days. This is a significant development in the Pacific's power politics as now the New World giant has turned its eyes to the East and the Chinese dragon finds herself a new ally."
 chi_faction.3.a: "Onwards!"

 chi_faction.4.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Refuses"
 chi_faction.4.d: "The negotiations between our two countries have unfortunately been unsuccessful. Despite our best efforts in trying to compromise with the Chinese delegation, the Chinese left the meeting - unwilling to work with us. We shall either decide to proceed with our attack on the Empire of Japan or hold back our forces for now."
 chi_faction.4.a: "Go ahead with the invasion."
 chi_faction.4.b: "This is too risky now."

 chi_flavor.1.t: "Chen Gongbo Publishes his Work"
 chi_flavor.1.d: "Frequently insulted as nothing more than Wang's lapdog by his political rivals, the Kuomintang politician Chen Gongbo has recently published his magnum opus in "Revolutions and Thought." A decidedly Marxist politician, Chen's work has attracted controversy from the more liberal-leaning leftist members of the Kuomintang, who are unwilling to combine Sun Yat-sen's ideology with Marxism.\n\nWhile he may have been a member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party in his youth, Chen Gongbo has long distanced himself from Chinese Marxism. However, he frequently employs syndicalist terminology and believes that history reflects "materialism". Denying himself to be a Marxist, Chen's views can only be described as eclectic or "Marxist-oriented."\n\nWritten during his exile in France but finished upon his return to China -  his latest work, "Revolutions and Thought," describes his weltanschauung, the idea that matter and motion were the fundamental constituents of the world. He argues that the Kuomintang must rise above capitalism and that the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, while it had toppled the capitalist order in Britain and France, merely asserted capitalism over the oppressed Chinese peoples, as evidenced by Germany's intervention in the Northern Expedition.\n\nHis work has been met with resounding approval from radical elements within the Reorganised Comrades Association. However, they have been met with sharp criticism by the RCA moderates and the Provisional Action Committee. Some in the Provisional Action Committee have even suggested censoring the book as it constitutes what they declare as decidedly syndicalist propaganda."
 chi_flavor.1.a: "A brilliant writer, that Chen Gongbo!"

 chi_flavor.2.t: "Song at Midnight"
 chi_flavor.2.d: "A new film has emerged within Chinese cinemas! This new cinematic masterpiece, which has been declared China's first horror film, is directed by the leftist-leaning director Ma-Xu Weibang. It draws influence from the 1923 American film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and the 1910 French novel, "La Fantome de l'Opera."\n\nCritics of the film have pointed out that the anxious tones of the horror genre seem to emulate the very anxiety the Chinese people hold in regard to the ever-changing political landscape of the land. Furthermore, the film's leftist and nationalist characters have led to the Kuomintang officially endorsing the film.\n\nStarring the handsome actor Jin Shan as Song Danping and the beautiful actress Hu Ping as Li Xiaoxia (Song Danping's lover), the film is set on a dark and stormy night in 1926. A group of actors arrive at a demolished theatre and begin practising for their show. One night, the play's lead, Sun Xiao'ou requests to practise his parts by himself, but he struggles with the lines. As he continues to rehearse, a mysterious voice suddenly lends its voice to the actor, helping him learn the lines. The actor decides to seek out this benevolent angel and finds that the voice belongs to none other than the famed actor Song Danping, who was thought to have been deceased.\n\nIn flashbacks, Danping reveals that prior to acting he had been a revolutionary in the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai. After the revolution's failure, he fled into hiding and fell in love with Li Xiaoxia. Danping's rival Tang Jun, however, has Danping tortured and attacked with acid. Embarrassed and ashamed of his visceral scars, Danping flees into hiding once more - which drives Xiaoxia to insanity. He spends his nights in the theatre, alone and hidden, comforting a mentally unstable Xiaoxia.\n\nIn the present day, the actor troupe makes it to their show and presents it to none other than the theatre's owner, Tang Jun. Tang takes a liking to Sun's girlfriend and tries to seize her when Sun fights back. In the struggle, Sun's lover dies but Danping emerges out of hiding to fight Tang Jun. The theatre viewers see Danping as a monster due to his disfigured face and attempt to chase him with torches. The film ends with Danping jumping to his death while Xiaoxia finally regains her sanity."

Prominent members of the group include Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, Feng Keng, Yin Fu, Ding Ling, and Li Weisen.\n\nWhile the group was initially associated with the robust leftist author Lu Xun, he quickly distanced himself from the group when it became clear that he would be sidelined. Many members of the group are syndicalists, owing to Shanghai's own growing leftist and nationalist union movements. Members of the group hold to the radical view that art should reflect the lives of the working class and that art should serve to advance politics, in particular socialism. While not officially associated with nor endorsed by the Kuomintang, they have tended to gravitate towards both the Reorganised Faction and the Provisional Action Committee. \n\nHowever, recently, a notable member of the group Hu Yepin has seemingly gone missing. His wife Ding Ling has frantically petitioned government officials including Song Qingling herself to inquire about the release of information pertaining to Hu's disappearance. He was found dead in a Shanghai back alley and although fingers are accusing rival Chinese syndicalist circles, there are also rumours that he had been kidnapped by members of Dai Chuanfang's Zhongteju."

 chi_flavor.4.t: "Creation of the CCBS"
 chi_flavor.4.d: "Following the successful First Repatriated Congress and the conclusion of the League War, the Nationalist government has immediately made efforts to establish its firm hold and grasp over the Chinese people's minds and hearts. At the end of the Congress, delegates from both the Provisional Action Committee and Reorganised Comrades Association, agreed that extensive radio broadcasting must be utilised in order to promote the danghua - the "partyfication" of Chinese society.\n\nOne of the Ministry's first accomplishments thus far was the revitalisation of the "Minguo Ribao" or the "People's Daily." Established as early as 1923 when the Nationalist Party was based in Shanghai - the newspaper was forced to flee overseas upon the failure of the Northern Expedition. Written in the Chinese vernacular, the Minguo Ribao is to be one pillar in the Nationalist propaganda system - they are placed under the guidance of the Central Daily News and the Central News Agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Communications opened a new bureaucratic office named the Telecommunications Office - to handle radio communication and broadcasting. Initial plans drawn up with the help of western engineers from the Third Internationale, have ambitiously envisioned a 500-watt transmitter covering the area between Nanjing and Shanghai. To facilitate the organisation of Party work at the local level as well as commence the "partyification" of the Chinese nation, the effort to improve communications throughout the country has so far exceeded expectations.\n\nThose with fluency in the Nanjing Dialect of Mandarin and of fluent literacy are encouraged to serve as technicians in the growing number of radio stations throughout the country. On this day, November 12, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday - the Nationalist radio station has officially been renamed the China Central Broadcasting System."

 chi_flavor.5.t: "Crossroads"
 chi_flavor.5.d: "A new slapstick comedy has emerged from the theatres from director Shen Xiling and starring Bai Yang and Zhao Dan. While comedic in nature, critics have pointed out that the film seems to take on political undertones in regard to the instability of Chinese politics and the rising threat of Japan.\n\nIt begins in a dock in Shanghai, where college graduate Xu is contemplating suicide when his friend Zhao (played by the notable Zhao Dan) leads him back to their apartment. We learn that these friends are unemployed in Shanghai as a result of the financial fiasco of Black Monday that severely depleted the city's economic strength. Meanwhile, a female graduate Yang (played by Bai Yang) moves next to Zhao as Zhao finds a job in the Minguo Ribao of the Kuomintang. A lighthearted feud breaks out between the two neighbours.\n\nHowever, what has become a light romance between Zhao and Yang, suddenly ends when Yang announces to Zhao one day that she is leaving Shanghai as the factory that she had been working in, had closed down. Zhao tries to convince Yang to stay but she decides to leave anyway. Yang's friend, who recognises their romance, convinces Yang to stay in Shanghai.\n\nZhao finds that he himself is out of work. He meets Yang and the two read in the newspaper, that Zhao's friend Xu had indeed committed suicide. Promising not to be "weak" like Xu, they march off into the sunset - optimistic of a hopeful future."

 chi_flavor.6.t: "Chen Bo'er"
 chi_flavor.6.d: "Born in the small town of Anbu in Chaozhou County in Guangdong Province, Chen Shenhua was born to a wealthy family and loved by her father and her mother (her father's concubine). Her elite status nonetheless, allowed her to go to a larger city for school and she studied in Nanjing and Shanghai. There, she became fluent in English in addition to her native Cantonese and her middle-school Mandarin.\n\nAs a prominent leftist, she joined the Kuomintang in 1937 in order to play a central role in China's growing socialist film industry. She is a talented writer, with her works commenting on the critical nature of feminism in China. Her writings explore the deeper psychoanalytical effects of the "male gaze" in cinema, a gaze that Chen Bo'er would strive to fight against.\n\nAs a result of her activism and her commitment to the socialist cause, the government of the Kuomintang has officially appointed her as China's first female film director. She accepted this position on the condition that she be allowed to draft her own cast, she envisions her casts as being drawn primarily from working-class backgrounds in order to better resonate her films' messages with the proletariat of China. She is also known to experiment with animation, a relatively new field in Chinese cinema where she uses paper-cut and folded hand-made animations to describe the ongoing revolutionary struggle."
 chi_flavor.6.a: "We support her efforts!"

 chi_flavor.7.t: "The Death of Lu Xun"
 chi_flavor.7.d: "A tragedy has emerged in the Chinese literary world today, as the great leftist writer Lu Xun has died perhaps as a result of his long-standing habit of being a heavy smoker. Just last year, he developed chronic tuberculosis and for the past few weeks, he has been in declining health. The Nationalist government officially offered their condolences.\n\nLu Xun began his literary career as did any other Chinese intellectual of the pre-Republican era, by studying the Confucian classics in preparation for the civil examinations. Lu Xun's father and grandfather were caught in a bribery scandal that saw his grandfather imprisoned and his father falling victim to a cruel addiction to opium. After attending school where he became exposed to western ideals, Lu Xun travelled to Japan in 1902 on a government scholarship and began translating famous western works into vernacular Chinese.\n\nUpon witnessing a photograph of a Chinese civilian being beheaded by a Japanese soldier during the Russo-Japanese War and seeing the utter apathy in the eyes of the Chinese bystanders, Lu Xun was convinced that China was in need of salvation. By the time the Xinhai Revolution arrived in 1911, he had ascended to a position of scholarship in Beijing. In 1917, he began writing for Chen Duxiu's "New Youth" where he published his successful short story "Diary of a Madman." He followed this success in 1927 with his grand work, "The True Story of Ah Q."\n\nA sympathetic individual towards the Kuomintang, Lu Xun served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa and the Zhongshan University on the eve of the Northern Expedition. After the expedition's failure, he fled for Shanghai although he remained sympathetic to Song Qingling's guerrilla war in Fujian. Upon the return of the Kuomintang in Nanjing after the League War, he sent Song a telegram, congratulating the National Revolutionary Army for its success."

 chi_flavor.8.t: "Chinese National Socialism"
 chi_flavor.8.d: "The China Reconstruction Society has often been denounced as a party of reactionaries. Its critics point to how its prominent leaders are purely military men, and to its near veneration of the legalistic China of the archaic Qin Empire.\n\nBut the CRS is indeed conscious of socialist reforms. Calling their economic model "National Socialism," the CRS envisions an economy that would be entirely planned by the state. This did not mean that all private enterprises were to disappear but rather that the CRS has advocated for the nationalisation of major industries throughout the land. All private capital would then be used to build up the country for collective use. The development of nationwide education, agriculture, industries, and infrastructure would come out of the pockets of private capital - to ensure the growth of a hardworking collective society.\n\nThe premier ideologue of the CRS' national socialist model comes from none other than He Zhonghan, one of Whampoa's Outstanding Graduates and a former mentee under the syndicalist Dong Biwu. He argues for the complete nationalisation of the land and the organisation of production by state-managed agricultural cooperatives. This strategy will avoid the issue of land redistribution while using the method state collectivisation to enhance harvest outputs. This will ensure that all notion of private property is eradicated in favour of shared land use for the purpose of national interests. Only time will tell whether or not their methods will be successful."
 chi_flavor.8.a: "Is this true socialism?"

 chi_flavor.9.t: "The Whampoa Revolutionary Alumni Association Council"
 chi_flavor.9.d: "The CRS is not the only organisation comprised of cadres from the Whampoa Military Academy. Led by the leader of the Provisional Action Committee, Deng Yanda - the Whampoa Revolutionary Alumni Association Council (WRAAC); the WRAAC believes that the core of the revolutionary struggle begins with its military. Making up the Old Guard of the National Revolutionary Army, the WRAAC holds true to their so-called "pure" interpretation of the late Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People.\n\nWhile in the West, a military-backed democracy sounds like a recipe for authoritarianism - that is not the case in China. Years of warlord instability and political instability such as the assassination of Song Jiaoren had convinced many - especially those in the Kuomintang, that China needed a guiding hand for democracy. The WRAAC's goal is to foster a revolutionary spirit within the cadres of Whampoa and to lay the grassroots of democracy - opposing the more radical factions of Whampoa, that advocate for the end of parliamentary chaos.\n\nSince its official proclamation to rival the CRS in recent weeks, the WRAAC has grown significantly in numbers. It has also been reported that the National Revolutionary Air Force leader Zhou Zirou and General Du Yuming had joined the association."
 chi_flavor.9.a: "Interesting."

 chi_flavor.10.t: "The Will of the Eternal Premier"
 chi_flavor.10.d: "In front of the large audience that was the Kuomintang's Central Committee and assembly, [CHI.GetLeader] began the Second Northern Expedition by reading the will of the late and revered Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The will had been drafted by Wang Jingwei himself but had been observed by the most senior members of the party such as Dai Jitao, Wu Zhihui, Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, He Xiangning, Sun Fo, and Zou Lu. As Sun lay dying of his sickness, the will is a testament to the wishes of the late Father of the Kuomintang.\n\n"For forty years, I have devoted myself to the cause of national revolution, the objective of which is to achieve liberty and equality for China. These forty years of experience have convinced me to realise such a goal, we must awaken our people, unite with the peoples of the world who treat us equally, and together to carry out a common fight.\n\nToday the success of the revolution has not been achieved. All my comrades must follow my writings, the Plan for National Reconstruction, The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People, and the Manifesto of the First National Congress, as well as continue their endeavours and accomplishments. Proposals to set up a National Convention and to abolish the unequal treaties especially need to be accomplished in the shortest time possible. This is my heartfelt charge to you." \n\nAs [CHI.GetLeader] finished the speech, the Committee erupted into shouts and cheers as the Kuomintang prepares to accomplish the mission that has yet to be finished!"
 chi_flavor.10.a: "We'll finish what you started!"

 chi_flavor.11.t: "The Ministry of Education"
 chi_flavor.11.d: "As part of the National Reconstruction Plan, a fundamental tenet of the Kuomintang's reconstruction policy is to promote literacy and champion the ideas of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Under a near-unanimous vote, the Ministry of Education is to be expanded significantly along with the premier institution of revolutionary academia, the Academia Sinica.\n\nCai Yuanpei hopes to sponsor the growth of Western-styled education in Chinese society. The former Chancellor of Peking University has long admired the European education model such as that of the French schooling system and hopes to emulate the French method. The planned Ministry of Education is to divide itself into the following departments: Counsellor's Office, Secretariat, Department of General Affairs, Department of Higher Education, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Department of Social Education, and Department of Mongolian and Tibetan Education (to promote the Three Principles within these ethnic groups). Furthermore, committees on specific forms of education like medicine and as well as the preservation of historical relics will also be created.\n\nFinally, the Academia Sinica is to be expanded. In addition to its administration, it will be expanded to include the institutes of Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, Astronomy, History, Philosophy, Meteorology, Chinese Literature, Education, Archaeology, Psychology, Social Sciences, Zoology, and Botany."

 chi_flavor.12.t: "Militarisation of the State"
 chi_flavor.12.d: "Toy stores across China have stopped selling children's balls, yo-yos, and dolls in favour of military figurines, toy military aircraft, and ships. In recent days and weeks, the government has encouraged the education of "Nationalist Militarism," hoping to educate the youth on the glories of the military and to encourage leadership to the Generalissimo.\n\nSchools encourage physical activity and training, emphasising group and collective efforts instead of individual achievements. Girls are encouraged to pursue nursing, and for boys, joining the military would be the most notable achievement one could make in life. The humanities would be discouraged in favour of the more practical subjects of the sciences such as physics, chemistry, and engineering. For example, chemistry classes would encourage the production of bombs.\n\nUltimately, from a young age, Chinese child is encouraged to love their country - to be willing to sacrifice their lives for the nation. They are taught that everything must be used for the state, and that there is no greater honour than to be a cog in the machine that is revolutionary China. Maps in classrooms show China with its irredentist claims over Outer Manchuria and Tawang, with daily rhetoric encouraging China to take its place in the world once more. To say that the Republic of China is authoritarian would be an understatement; the country has descended into a classless socialist totalitarian nation. As long as the China Reconstruction Society exists, it shall continue to lead the Chinese workers and soldiers forward in solidarity - forward, a bulwark of the revolution, to revive Zhonghua once and for all!"

 chi_flavor.13.t: "Whampoa Class of [GetYear]"
 chi_flavor.13.d: "The 7th Class of the Republic of China Military Academy, the class of [GetYear] is about to become inaugurated - as the newest line of cadets in the National Revolutionary Army. While many new cadets are Chinese, there are also those in the cadet ranks, like Chang Cheol-bu, who is Korean, and some Vietnamese volunteers.\n\n[CHI.GetLeader] gave a passionate speech in front of the newly inaugurated recruits, citing that they were proud to witness the next generation of the National Revolutionary Army. The recruits then recited their oaths of loyalty to the National Revolutionary Army, echoing the school's motto of fraternity, sincerity, and devotion without hesitation. Since its revival after the League War, the Academy's original gate description of "Don't go into this door because you are greedy for life and fearful for death" has been rewritten. The recruits of Whampoa go into the academy expecting nothing more - than to become martyrs for the revolutionary cause.\n\nWhile there are certainly those who question the immense role of the military in the Kuomintang's politics, many agree that the emphasis on a robust martial spirit will be key to unification. If China is to be unified, she must be led by a revolutionary patriotic cadre, greater and mightier than any of the warlord armies."

 chi_flavor.14.t: "Fate of the Beiyang Navy"
 chi_flavor.14.d: "Debate and arguments were held today in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to discuss the fate of the admirals of the former Beiyang Navy in both the Zhili Clique and the Fengtian Clique. While their service to the traitorous warlords leaves much to be desired, the newly formed Republican navy lacks a number of admirals - due to years of fighting a guerrilla insurgency and being overseas.\n\nIn contrast, the admirals of the Fengtian and Zhili navies trace their naval lineage to the original Beiyang Fleet - formed in 1871. In addition to having access to the relatively few modern ships in China, they also hold naval experience from overseas advisors - especially those from the Imperial German Navy.\n\nNonetheless, while prominent admirals such as Sa Zhenbing have promised loyalty to the new central government, hardliners in the government have vowed not to cede an inch of amnesty to the former members of the warlord cliques. To do so, they argue, would be to forgive traitors that sold out our country to the foreign imperialists. After closing arguments were held, the military tribunal has decided to..."

 chi_flavor.15.t: "The Chinese Syndicalist Party"
 chi_flavor.15.d: "The Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP) is the name given to the loosely aligned worker's unions that follow the ideas of European syndicalism. Constrained to mostly the factories and ports of the Legation Cities or the mineworkers of China, many members of the Reorganised Comrades Association hold cordial ties with the CSP - or have even been a part of the CSP at one point.\n\nThe CSP's presence within the Left Kuomintang is minimal. As a condition of achieving support from the Third Internationale, the Kuomintang allowed the CSP to serve as a junior partner in the Chinese Nationalist Revolution. But despite their warm ties with some of the Kuomintang's more radical leftists, they have been approached with scrutiny and suspicion by the Old Guard of the KMT, who see them as a potential threat in the future.\n\nThe differences in European syndicalism have also shown themselves in the political thought of the CSP. Proponents of Orthodox Syndicalism follow Li Lisan, and his "Li Lisan" line argues for using the urban-based syndicalist movement to launch a revolution in cooperation with the Kuomintang. Basing his doctrine on the Orthodox Syndicalists of Paris, Li Lisan sees cooperation and compromise as a means of achieving the syndicalist revolution for China.\n\nHe is opposed overseas by the socialist Wang Ming and the so-called "28 Syndicalists" who reside in France, far away from the revolution in China. To call the 28 Syndicalists, radicals would be an understatement. They are drawn to France's "ultra syndicalists" and believe that all power should go to the unions - particularly the CSP. Nonetheless, despite falling often falling into factional disputes, members of the Reorganised Faction of the Kuomintang are quite close with prominent CSP members - with some Reorganised members even once holding CSP membership."

 chi_flavor.16.t: "The ACDWF is Formed"
 chi_flavor.16.d: "As the Chinese revolution continues, the issue of women's rights and the role of women in the national revolution has come around. While conservatives within the Kuomintang movement have tended to shy away from the assumption of female inferiority, the leadership of China's first women Chairwoman has undoubtedly led to the newfound popularity of the women's rights movement.\n\nDuring their time in the Jiangfu Insurgency, women fought side by side with men - often tending to the wounded as nurses or, in some cases, even participating in the fighting. Spearheaded by the elderly figurehead feminist leader of He Xiangning, numerous female leaders and politicians within the Kuomintang have officially declared the creation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation (ACDWF). The organisation is not just dedicated to promoting the status of women, but it also has the goal of helping to build a genuinely egalitarian and socialist China. Comprised of numerous women's groups and sponsored publicly by Chairwoman Song Qingling, the ACDWF announced that one of Song's proteges, Cai Chang is to serve as the organisation's president.\n\nA firm believer in woman's education and a feminist who had taken a vow of celibacy, Cai Chang left a job as a physical education teacher to join the Nationalist movement in 1925. When the Northern Expedition failed, she fled with Song Qingling to the Jiangfu Insurgency, where she became close with other female nationalists, such as Deng Yingchao. She represents the growing role of women in the New China, a China that seeks not only the liberation of the workers and peasants but also of womankind."

 chi_flavor.17.t: "The Reclamation of Taiwan"
 chi_flavor.17.d: "Across the Chinese nation today, people from around the country tuned in to their local radio broadcasts from the Nationalist CCBS as the radio announcer made a startling declaration. The Republic of China had officially declared war on Japan in a Third Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese government had earlier this week demanded the complete return of Taiwan island back to the Republic of China, the island which had been taken by the Japanese nearly forty-one years prior during the Sino-Japanese War. Yet the Chinese have not forgotten this humiliation and the Nationalist Party has made it a goal that Taiwan must be returned to China at all costs. With the formal declaration of war, communications and foreign channels between [JAP.GetNameDef] and the Republic of China have officially broken down and a state of warning has been issued across the East China Sea.\n\nWhile Japan's naval and air forces may very well be one of the most advanced in Asia, if not the world - none can best the Chinese spirit. Chinese morale is especially high given the recent victory over the Japanese on the Chinese mainland with victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The announcer reminded the eager listeners that "For territorial integrity, for national unity, we will, we will liberate Taiwan!" Across the nation, propaganda has clearly aroused the Chinese nation as thousands have been reported to have shown up at recruiting centres - ready to retake Taiwan for the motherland."
 chi_flavor.17.a: "We will liberate Taiwan!"

 chi_flavor.18.t: "The RCA in Shanxi"
 chi_flavor.18.d: "While in its original inception, the Reorganised Comrades Association was a relatively secret organisation within the Kuomintang, since the return to the Chinese mainland from exile - the RCA has made efforts to strengthen the RCA cause and movement from province to province. While quite far from the mountainous province of Shanxi, under the direction and coordination of the RCA central headquarters in Nanjing - the Kuomintang has made contact with the Shanxi General Labour Union and the Taiyuan Municipal Labour Union Association. Organised in small cells of 3-9 men, the RCA travels throughout China planting these revolutionary cells in the hopes that they grow and become "sub-branches" of at least ten cells -  preparing the semination of revolutionary dissent and uprising.\n\nIt's no secret that Feng Yuxiang, leader of the Guominjun, holds sympathies towards the Kuomintang cause - in particular, their dedication to socialism, revolution to the masses, and the end of feudal ways. There are also whispers in the dark that members of Yan and Feng's inner circles are members of the RCA and quietly provide intel to the Kuomintang's government in [CHI.Capital.GetName]. This penetration of local domestic politics within Shanxi has led to a more robust voice from Shanxi's political left, once dormant with the stagnated political situation of the post-Xuantong Restoration - has now once more begun to clamour for the national revolution."

 CHI_dai_chunfeng: "Dai Chunfeng"
 CHI_dai_chunfeng_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 28th, 1897, in Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies seized control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_desc: "§YAdvisor Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 28th, 1897, in Zhejiang, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gVarious stories explain how the silent yet ambitious protegé of Chiang Kai-shek came to the Kuomintang. Some say that he was introduced to the Whampoa Military Academy by one of its leading members of the KMT right, Dai Jitao - others say he was introduced by his friend Mao Rendang. The "laoban" of the ZhongTeju has never revealed his origins and following his shady character - most likely never will.\n\nBorn in Zhejiang, Dai lived a rough life amidst the dim lights of Shanghai's filthiest underground quarters. Until 1923, he was mentored by the leader of the Axe Gang, Wang Yaqiao. A skilled gambler, it was here in Shanghai where he met Du Yusheng - head of the Green Gang and an associate of Chiang Kai-shek's. From there, he entered Whampoa's Sixth Class and became a favourite of Chiang's, helping Chiang keep an eye on subversive elements within the party's left-wing.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition failed, Dai fled to the Legation Cities, where he continued his underground criminal activities. As such, he was able to develop an incredibly complex intelligence organisation, due to his already established networks in the underground - some regard his intelligence agency as perhaps the largest in China. For years, he had been coordinating activities with Song Qingling's insurgent zone, and upon the return of the Central Committee - he was ready to meet them with open arms...§!"

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_sic_desc: "§YAdvisor Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 28th, 1897, in Zhejiang, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gWhen outsiders peer into the new hardliner government of the Republic of China, intelligence officers, academics and \"Old China hands\" often debate who is truly holding the reins. At the top of course is the Lingxiu, the leader the Chinese Reconstruction Society claim to follow unquestioningly: Generalissimo Hu Zongnan. But between him and his millions of followers, things grow murky. Ostensibly, the Premier of the Executive Branch (the somewhat equivalent to Prime Minister), Sun Fo, would be his chief deputy. But no one really buys that narrative. Others claim Hu is the figurehead of a wider NRA junta with Deng Wenyi and He Zhonghan or that he is under the sway of the so-called Four Elders of the Party.\n\nNo one, it appears, seems to realise the truth, and that's the way Dai Chunfeng prefers it. A minor protégé of Chiang Kai-shek, the second half of the Republic's leading duumvirate rules from the shadows-relying on his close friendship with Hu Zongnan, a powerful intelligence apparatus, and extensive connections with the criminal underworld.\n\nThis mysterious political operator, the "laoban" of the Zhongteju, cultivates a small cult-like following of his own within his fiefdom. Dai insists on an utter dedication to the Chinese nation and a staunchly Confucian morality despite his own prior affiliation with the Shanghai underground. Agents are forbidden from gambling and smoking, and are expected to be celibate - all for the sake of China.\n\nAlthough by day Hu Zongnan and the army boisterously rule China, the CRS march to the tune of national regeneration and the civilian leadership keep along the best they can, everyone knows to some extent that in the darkness all are watched by the Zhongteju.§!"

 CHI_chen_duxiu: "Chen Duxiu"
 CHI_chen_duxiu_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October 8th, 1879, in Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A lifelong experience of failing his Confucian exams taught Chen Duxiu one thing - that the old order had to go. Centuries of archaic decrepit institutions from the perfidious Manchus simply clogged the progression of mankind, especially in regard to the Marxist interpretation of history.\n\nIn 1915, he would go on to found the popular journal "New Youth" and joined fellow leftist educator Cai Yuanpei in Beijing where both men lashed out against the perceived backwardness of China and the necessity for a new model, a new method to allow China to enter the modern age and reassert herself in the world once more. In Beijing, he was attracted to Li Dazhao's Marxist study group and when word broke out of the revolution in France in 1919, Chen Duxiu believed that a syndicalist model was China's natural progression in the Marxist historical materialist model - that the workers and peasants of Chinese society would lead the revolution against the corrupt bourgeoisie and feudal warlords that were leading China to ruin. As such in 1921, Chen Duxiu and other prominent socialist leaders gathered in Shanghai to proclaim the Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP).\n\nWhen the Kuomintang rose up in 1923, the Commune of France's recognition of the Kuomintang was granted only on the condition that the Kuomintang accept the CSP as a junior partner in the national revolution. Given the CSP's small size and lack of popular support among the rural peasantry and petit bourgeoisie, Chen Duxiu naturally accepted. However, when the Northern Expedition ended in failure in 1927, the Chinese Syndicalist Party fled alongside the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu headed for a life of secrecy and exile, changing locations frequently from friendly Guangdong to the narrow alleyways of Shanghai's red-light districts.\n\n Against the odds, the Syndicalist Party of China has come to power and a new era dawns for the Chinese workers. As Chen Duxiu takes up the mantle of leadership, no doubt the disagreements and factionalism that have arisen in the exile will come to the surface as the CSP calls to convene. And while the CSP has unified the country under the banner of syndicalism, it was only due to the aid of a foreign nation -but a victory nonetheless, as Chen Duxiu's visions for China slowly become reality."

 CHI_wang_jingwei: "Wang Jingwei"
 CHI_wang_jingwei_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 4th, 1883, in Sanshui, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! In his youth, Wang Jingwei was enamoured with the lives of Saigo Takamori and Katsu Kaishu, seeing them as model men who transformed Japan from a backwater into an industrial nation. How can it be that China is so stagnant, he wondered - turning to the works of Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen. In the latter, he saw a beloved mentor, and in Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, he exploded into national prominence when he attempted to assassinate the Zaifeng regent (father of Emperor Puyi), although he failed and was imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang was freed, but he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the disillusioned Sun, who had found himself sidelined by national politics and the warlords. He instead travelled to France but returned shortly when Sun returned to Guangzhou in 1921 to participate in the newly revived revolutionary government. Wang was present at the party's reorganisation in 1924 and it was here that he began to represent the party's leftist wing, although he hardly fancied himself as a socialist ideologue. When Sun died in 1925, it was Wang that was present on his deathbed in writing his will.\n\nThe triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei quickly became one of Kuomintang's most contested and bitter power struggles. However, following Hu Hanmin's assassination in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek's assassination following the failure of the Northern Expedition, Wang finally achieved his birthright of becoming Sun's rightful successor. But the collapse of the expedition forced him and his closest political allies to flee to Europe in the hopes of one day returning to carry out Sun's will. In exile, he has emerged as the de-facto leader of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, far and often distant from the Jiangfu insurgency on the mainland.\n\nAt last, he has returned and claimed his birthright as Chairman of the Kuomintang. With a cadre of loyal supporters in his time and exile and his pragmatic desires to work with his syndicalist allies, Wang will have to be ruthless and willing - if he is to secure the position of Dr. Sun's rightful successor."

 CHI_song_qingling: "Song Qingling"
 CHI_song_qingling_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 27th, 1893, in Pudong, Shanghai, Shanghai International Settlement\n§YPolitical Career:§! A rebel from her youth, Song Qingling explicitly challenged her parents' opposition to her marriage to the late and honourable Dr. Sun Yat-sen, going as far as to run away from home to elope with the revolutionary statesman. Western-educated, fluent in English and Chinese, graceful, elegant, and charitable - she demonstrated her utmost loyalty to the revolutionary cause when she told Sun to flee ahead of the warlord Chen Jiongming's bombardment, despite reportedly suffering a miscarriage and never being able to bear children again.\n\nLoyal to his side, she was with Sun when he agreed to work with the Third Internationale and was present at his deathbed when his final will was read aloud. And then came the Northern Expedition, in which she participated in the Northern Expedition, untouchable and unchallenged by anyone within the Kuomintang due to her status as the widow of the great Dr. Sun. But when the expedition failed, she refused to see it as the revolution's failure. Instead, she and other leftist Kuomintang generals fled to the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone, where she spent her time travelling between the insurgent zone and Shanghai to secure aid and support for the guerrilla war against the despicable Zhili Warlords.\n\nServing alongside her had been none other than her close friend - Deng Yanda. The two had been together since the halcyon days of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government and found themselves united, a brother and a sister in the revolutionary struggle.\n\nAt last, however, she finds herself merely more than the figurehead of the Jiangfu Zone… no, she has ascended to the Chairwoman of the Kuomintang. Now, she commands not merely the mantle of the Chinese Revolution but the revolution for all oppressed peoples worldwide - the promise and dream of her late husband will finally become a reality."

The eldest son of Dr Sun Yat-sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the so-called "Reorganisation" programme represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."

When the Northern Expedition broke out, Li served as Governor of Guangdong, Military Affairs Commissioner, and acting president of Whampoa.\n\nBut when the expedition failed, he was blamed for not holding on to Guangzhou, which had fallen into German hands, and was thus blamed for costing the KMT what could have been a triumphant revolution. As much of the party fled for France, Li stayed behind - convincing a remnant of the National Revolutionary Army to remain and fight as guerrilla forces.

A prominent Marxist and representative of Guangdong's Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP) branch, in 1922, he withdrew from the CSP due to his support for Chen Jiongming. In 1923, he travelled to New York to study at Columbia University, and in 1925, was recruited to the Kuomintang by its leftist leader Liao Zhongkai. Following the failure of the Northern Expedition, Chen, like many others in the left wing of the party, fled to the Commune of France.\n\nWithin the party's radical wing, he has often been identified as its "chief ideologue," and indeed, many wonder how much sway he has with a close friend and de facto leader of the Kuomintang, Wang Jingwei.\n\nHistory according to Chen Gongbo flows in matter and motion, the two of which Chen believes are the driving force behind human progress. It is only inevitable that just as historical materialism shows, the Reorganisation of the Kuomintang is merely the natural scientific progression of the Chinese National Revolution. Chen's views are Marxist, as shown in his recently published work "Revelations in Chinese History" and his newspaper "The Revolutionary Critic." To the ever-so-pretentious Chen, the Kuomintang must be the revolutionary vanguard, and its ranks must be filled with determined comrades willing to purge and "reorganise" the party along correct ideological lines. From there, the one-party state will reorganise the workers and peasants of the country into economic producers of society - with the eventual goal of utopian socialist economic cooperatives in both the agricultural and urban sectors of the country. He envisions a China built from the ground up by the workers and for the workers, one that will finally break the chains of western imperialism by pursuing its native capital with the help of the state. As such, economically he does support the confiscation of land by force through the peasantry should the landlords not accept government intervention. With Wang's consolidation of rule following the First Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang, Chen emerged as the premier leader of the RCA's radical wing - with his advice and loyalty ever so valued by the Chairman.§!"

After he moved to Shenyang in Manchuria where his uncle worked in the civil service, Zhou became infatuated with learning new ideas from intellectuals and radicals such as Liang Qichao, Zou Rong, and Kang Youwei. Zhou's intellect and charisma helped him secure the highly famous Nankai Middle School - where he caught the eye of the school's founder, the scholar Zhang Boling.\n\nGradating from Nankai as one of its two valedictorians; Zhou travelled to Japan in 1917 to pursue further studies as the Weltkrieg raged on. He found Japan's highly elitist and militaristic culture unfit for him; instead, Zhou rejected the idea that the Japanese model was sufficient for a country such as China. With the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and Chen Duxiu's New Youth in full swing shortly after - Zhou became firmly committed and sympathetic towards Marxist and leftist ideals. He would travel to France in 1920 alongside the Chinese Work-Study Programme, which included his future wife, Deng Yingchao.\n\nWith news of Sun Yat-sen's revolution reborn in Guangzhou, most nationalistic leftist parties such as the Chinese Syndicalist Party of which Zhou was an affiliate began to work with the Kuomintang.

In 1924, he returned to China, where he joined Sun's revolution in Guangzhou and helped prepare the National Revolutionary Army as director of political education.\n\n He would then participate in two of the NRA's expeditions before joining the ill-fated Northern Expedition.

Furthermore, he saw in the school's first principal, the great Chiang Kai-shek, an exemplary if not outstanding leader - one needed to reignite the vigour of China and end centuries of humiliation.\n\nHowever, the Northern Expedition was a failure, and He fled to Europe. Here, he would be reunited with several of his former Whampoa classmates, such as Deng Wenyi and the sons of his former mentor Chiang. This so-called \"Young Guard\" of Whampoa has been studying in the Union of Britain since the early 1930s. With the return of the Central Committee, they hope to bring the same revolutionary spirit of Whampoa back to the National Revolutionary Army.§!\n\n§YNotes: A member of the China Reconstruction Society, he is known for being a fierce ideologue of the movement's views - and is often seen as the second in command within the CRS faction.§!"

His father worked overseas, so he was brought up primarily by his uncle, who sent him to a private school. In 1912, Huang entered the Guangzhou Normal School where he was first exposed to revolutionary ideas. He attended the Baoding Military Academy and served in an artillery regiment of the Frontier Defence Army. Increasingly sympathetic to the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, Huang returned to Guangdong in 1922 and joined the Kuomintang two years later. Huang’s first position in the NRA was commanding a battalion in the campaign against Chen Jiongming’s forces. During the Northern Expedition, Huang served in the Fourth “Iron” Army alongside Ye Ting and Zhang Fakui. Though fighting valiantly, the Fourth Army was eventually routed by the Zhili Clique, and Huang ended up following the KMT leadership into exile. In France, he drew increasingly close to Deng Yanda and became a founding member of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang. Huang accompanied Dang back to China in 1932 for the Shanghai Uprising, and when that failed the two escaped to the JiangFu Insurgent Zone to continue the fight.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a close friend and confidant of Deng Yanda, he is a prominent member of the Provisional Action Committee.§!"

After graduation, he served on the cruiser "Hai Rong" and when the Xinhai Revolution broke out he supported the revolutionaries. In 1921, he served as captain of the Yangtze River Patrol and by 1924, he held the title of rear admiral. When the Northern Expedition broke out in 1925, Chen Jiling chose to defect to the National Revolutionary Army. However, the revolution's failure prompted him to follow much of the Central Committee into retreat in Europe. Since he already held the qualifications of an experienced seaman, he naturally found a home in the Union of Britain - where he has been studying the latest in naval tactics and developments with the hope that one day he will be able to bring about the creation of China's own modern fleets."

He instead travelled overseas to the newly proclaimed Commune of France where he met fellow leftists, socialists, and syndicalists such as Cai Hsen, Cai Chang, and Deng Xiaoping. He then participated in the Work-Study Programme where he worked in French factories but in 1921, he left France to study at the Chemical Engineering Department at the Université du Travail in Belgium. During his stay in Belgium, he gradually turned further to the left and joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nIn 1924, he joined the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the director of the Kuomintang's communications department in Paris. It was around this time, that he attended the military school in Saint-Cyr and in 1925, he returned to China with French aid and weapons to aid in the Northern Expedition. He served under Zhou Enlai in the Political Department, where he essentially acted as Zhou's protege.
