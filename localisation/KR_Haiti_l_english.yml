### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noirist writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologes, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noirist once-allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

haiti.54.t:0 "Noirist Coup"
haiti.54.d:0 "While the Garde has for so long attempted to root out the Noirists, it seems they have now revealed themselves - and with guns in their hands at that. Port-Au-Prince has erupted into street battles between Noirist and the Garde, with the Noirists slowly working their way towards the city centre and our government."
