### Set Up Events - Reed ###
amcivwar.1.t:0 "President Reed Escapes to Chicago"
amcivwar.1.d:0 "President Reed has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognize the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling specter of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."

amcivwar.2.t:0 "Huey Long Declares the American Union State"
amcivwar.2.d:0 "In a fiery speech in New Orleans, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor MacArthur and pretender Reed. Both are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America.

From Chicago, Reed's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in New Orleans, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."

### Set Up Events - Olson ###

amcivwar.11.t:0 "Huey Long Condemns the Government"
amcivwar.11.d.nothing_is_done:0 "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Huey Long to declare on the radio that President Olson is both a traitor and a conman, intent on selling out the American people to bankers and the syndicalists, and that both he and Reed must be fought to preserve the American way of life. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognize its authority."
amcivwar.11.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed, and with its failure America has been broken. Huey Long declared on the radio today that the corrupt President Olson and the tyrannical Reed both must be stopped for the good of America, and has called for all decent Americans to rise up against them. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate, and while they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognize the government's authority within their borders."
amcivwar.11.d.assassination_long:0 "The assassination attempt against Huey Long has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the AFP needed. Huey Long today denounced President [USA.GetName] and Jack Reed both as traitors and tyrants, and has rallied his supporters to defend their way of life against tyranny. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the [USA.GetName] government as legitimate. While they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognize the government's authority within their borders."
amcivwar.11.d.assassination_reed:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Jack Reed, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as corrupt and beyond redemption.

He said it is time for the worker to make a stand. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
amcivwar.12.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed and with its failure, America has been broken. Jack Reed today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Olson and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Reed to oversee the restructuring of the government 'as the founding fathers intended'."
amcivwar.12.d.full_demands:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Huey Long, Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as puppets of their capitalist masters.

amcivwar.13.d:0 "President Floyd Olson experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either southern populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Olson steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put in place to restore order in the nation. In response, President Olson has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."

### Set Up Events - Garner ###
amcivwar.14.t:0 "Huey Long Condemns the Federal Government"

In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with the syndicalists of the SPA, and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos.

In response, President Garner has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."

The IWW proclaim we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people immediately. The up-and-coming Vanguard has called for their immediate arrest and execution as well, citing the fate of Vladimir Lenin as an example of a revolution defeated by leniency. SPA members belonging to the depreciated AFL, along with several loyal Progressives have sought life over death. Asking the Central Committee to only expropriate what is necessary for war, and keep their materialist constituents happy. "

amcivwar.32.t:0 "The Life of William Crawley Released in Theatres"
amcivwar.32.d:0 "The revolutionary agitprop have just released the story of the life of Willaim Crawley, a humble son of Florida. Filmed on a modern sound stage, the daring rescue is portrayed by ex-Hollywood Paul Robeson. Although the real life William Crowley preferred the church choir, Paul Robeson's musical numbers were jaunty popular tunes. The film has proven to be a smashing success at the box office, beating out an adaptation of Jack London's The Iron Heel at the opening weekend. The press caught up to William Crawley, where he commented that the film is 'Quite the spectacle on our great liberation'."
amcivwar.32.a:0 "Splendid"

amcivwar.33.t:0 "Directive 213: War Syndicalism"
amcivwar.33.d:0 "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalisation of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."

A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronised attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."

The AFL, which had seen a decline in membership before 1935, was revitalized by Reed's endorsement. Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have chosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their allegiance to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation. Now Reed must decide whether it is more danger to continue his support for the IWW, when compromise is in sight. "

amcivwar.37.d:0 "The revolution must succeed, but the revolution is also for the people. When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritized over the other, hard choices must be made.

amcivwar.38.d:0 "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"

amcivwar.39.d:0 "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."

amcivwar.40.d:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Reed, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"
amcivwar.40.a:0 "The CIA will be created!"
amcivwar.40.b:0 "It is not necessary for now"

amcivwar.41.t:0 "Red Terror"
amcivwar.41.d:0 "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Reed has made an executive decision to suppress these reports from the free media. 'If the revolution were to fail because of a few bad apples', says Reed 'then humanity would collectively suffer for centuries longer'."

amcivwar.42.d:0 "The war is not going our way. The detestable capitalists have pushed back our forces on all fronts, and we are in danger of running out of troops to man the guns we have. Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11. While this would provide us with the manpower needed to fight the revolution, quite a number of members of the Central Committee have expressed horror at this drastic measure."

These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."

amcivwar.46.b:0 "I will not betray my ideals!"

amcivwar.47.t:0 "War Powers Committee"
amcivwar.47.d:0 "Business leaders within our territory have formed a committee ostensibly in support of Huey Long in order to coordinate the war effort on his behalf called the War Powers Committee. Just as Huey Long himself had created offices to handle the monumental task of fighting for America, so did the industrialists take it upon themselves to create an industrial institution. Though they do not have all the power that they were promised, they have declared themselves to be the arsenal the AUS, and are led by controversially anti-Semitic but respected general George Van Horn Moseley."

amcivwar.48.d:0 "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists. How shall we respond?"

amcivwar.48.b:0 "Pelley gives me the creeps"

amcivwar.49.t:0 "The Silver Legion"
amcivwar.49.d:0 "Along the way during the national tour, William Pelley came into contact with radio preacher Herbert W. Armstrong. In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war. As these have entered the rumour mill there is nothing we can do to stop these promises from spreading."

This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organizations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job.

amcivwar.90.t:0 "Support from the Resistance"
amcivwar.90.d:0 "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scaveneged supplies."
amcivwar.90.a:0 "It will be a great help"

amcivwar.91.t:0 "Support from Syndicalists"
amcivwar.91.d:0 "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scaveneged supplies."

amcivwar.93.a:0 "It will be a great help"

amcivwar.94.t:0 "Syndicalist Uprising in the West"
amcivwar.94.d:0 "Fighting along the West Coast between syndicalist sympathizers and security forces has been severe in recent weeks, but dropped off within the last weeks - leading to hopes that the unions out west had finally given up hope of success. These hopes were dashed as a new uprising was revealed, with a number of militias organized by powerful Teamster and Longshoremen unions in Washington and Oregon state and armed through underground efforts. This opens up a new front in the civil war, should the rebels find a way to break out of the mountains."
amcivwar.94.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.94.b:0 "More syndicalist scum?!"

amcivwar.95.t:0 "Longist Rebels Rise in Kentucky"
amcivwar.95.d:0 "Huey Long always held strong support in the heartland, with states like Kentucky and Indiana only barely swinging elsewhere in the 1936 election. Now, Longist supporters have risen up in Kentucky and the surrounding region, taking up arms gained through the underground to band together and open a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.95.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.95.b:0 "This will not help them in the long run"

amcivwar.96.t:0 "Loyalists Rise in Pennsylvania"
amcivwar.96.d:0 "Support for the federal government remains strong even in the syndicalist heartland of Pennsylvania, and this has finally been proven as bands of loyalist militia -- reportedly organized in the city of Philadelphia -- rose up in the hills in the central part of the state, claiming the region once more for federal control. Whether they will achieve that goal and open up a new front in the civil war remains to be seen."
amcivwar.96.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.96.b:0 "A futile effort"

amcivwar.97.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Rebels"
amcivwar.97.d:0 "We are seeing increased activity by [From.GetAdjective] supporters in [Root.GetNameDef], no doubt supported and funded by the [From.GetAdjective] government. Their funneling of weapons through the underground has led up to rebels rising behind the lines, no doubt intended to harass our forces. Whether they will prove a serious threat remains to be seen."
amcivwar.97.a:0 "We shall endure"

amcivwar.98.t:0 "Resistance Rises in Midwest"
amcivwar.98.d:0 "Support for the democratic proponents in the Pacific government has been strong in the American Midwest, with several protests on the streets frequent - many of whom appear to be placing blame for the civil war squarely on the shoulders of General MacArthur. These protests have recently become more organized, and have culminated in a widespread uprising across Colorado, quietly funded and equipped through underground means. Whether these rebels will succeed in opening up a new front for the civil war remains to be seen."
amcivwar.98.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.98.b:0 "A nuisance at best"

amcivwar.100.t:0 "Syndicalist Uprising in Georgia"
amcivwar.100.d:0 "It seems there are more than a few disaffected supporters of Huey Long who are angry enough that they've defected to the CSA's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organizing in the hills of southern Georgia, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.100.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.100.b:0 "They should make up their minds"

amcivwar.102.t:0 "Longist Uprising in California"
amcivwar.102.d:0 "It seems there are more than a few disaffected SPA milita members who are angry enough that they've defected to the AUS's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organizing in the hills of southern California, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.102.a:0 "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.102.b:0 "It makes no difference"

amcivwar.125.t:0 "Jack Reed Calls for Action"
amcivwar.125.d.long:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Huey Long, Jack Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
amcivwar.125.d.austerity:0 "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's collusion with Huey Long and the AFP, Jack Reed has seized the moment and called on American workers to rise up against a tyrannical system which has betrayed them. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

amcivwar.127.t:0 "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.127.d.long:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, citing a direct link between the federal government and the recent assassination of Huey Long, and have thrown their support behind syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but have declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until [USA.GetLeader] steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put into place to restore order in the nation. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] has given the governors thirty days to stand down or be collectively arrested - an order none of them appear interested in obeying, making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
amcivwar.127.d.austerity:0 "While President [USA.GetLeader] celebrated a recent victory by passing a massive austerity bill to rescue the American economy, with support from from Huey Long and the America First Party, the bill had the opposite effect on the Socialist Party of America. Today several governors have declared the government illegitimate and thrown their support behind Jack Reed. They have declared that the Federal government holds no authority within their borders until [USA.GetLeader] steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under Reed is put into place to restore order in the nation. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] has given the governors thirty days to stand down or be collectively arrested - an order none of them appear interested in obeying, making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
amcivwar.127.a:0 "I see"

amcivwar.128.t:0 "The Second Civil War"
amcivwar.128.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader]'s deadline has come and gone, and with large militia forces having been raised in the CSA already it is clear what their answer truly is. The Second American Civil War has begun."
amcivwar.128.a:0 "Not again..."

amcivwar.130.t:0 "Huey Long Declares Union State"
amcivwar.130.d.reed:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Jack Reed, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of southern governors immediately declared their support for Long, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
amcivwar.130.d.compromise:0 "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's apparent embrace of a syndicalist agenda, Huey Long has seized the moment and called on Americans to rise up against a system that was about to betray them to tyranny. A number of southern governors immediately declared their support for Long, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

amcivwar.133.a:0 "Not again..."

amcivwar.135.t:0 "Jack Reed Calls for Action"
amcivwar.135.d:0 "Jack Reed has given a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against the twin tyrants of General MacArthur and Huey Long. Within the hour, a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared both Huey Long and General MacArthur as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Reed's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

amcivwar.136.t:0 "Huey Long Declares the American Union State"
amcivwar.136.d:0 "In a fiery speech in New Orleans, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor General MacArthur and pretender Jack Reed. Both are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognized that they recognize the authority of neither MacArthur nor Reed."
amcivwar.136.a:0 "Stand by the Republic"

amcivwar.137.t:0 "Pacific Governors Declare Emergency"
amcivwar.137.d:0 "The governors of the Pacific states have declared that MacArthur, Huey Long, and Jack Reed are all traitors, tyrants, and enemies of America. They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead refuse to recognize the authority of any of the competing governments. Governor Frank Merriam announced at the Sacramento legislature that, if push came to shove, they would see 'proper democracy' restored to the country by force."

amcivwar.138.t:0 "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.138.d:0 "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States as General Douglas MacArthur and the American military have taken over control of the government from its democratically-elected president - to, as he stated in a national broadcast, 'prevent inaction from leading the United States into the hands of radicals'. From Chicago, Jack Reed's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as has the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in New Orleans, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
amcivwar.138.a:0 "I see"

amcivwar.139.t:0 "The Second American Civil War"
amcivwar.139.d:0 "The federal government's deadline has come and gone, and with large militia forces having been raised on every side it is clear what their answer truly is. The Second American Civil War has begun."

### Foreign Interventions

amcivwar.150.t:0 "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.150.d:0 "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, and - even worse - the Socialist Party of America has proclaimed a stronghold right off our southern border. A number of the northeastern governors in New England, their states beset by syndicalist militia violence, have formally asked the Canadian government to intervene. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by some of the factions less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken. For New England, at least, that might not be quick enough to save them."
amcivwar.150.d.nocsa:0 "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, though it seems as if we are spared the possibility of an American syndicalist uprising. Even so, the violence has been extreme and several governors of American states from the northeast in New England have asked us to intervene and restore order. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by the Federal government less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken."
amcivwar.150.a:0 "Hold off on any intervention"
amcivwar.150.b:0 "Move into New England, as requested"

amcivwar.151.t:0 "Alaska Requests Intervention"
amcivwar.151.d:0 "The American territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor is fearing a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to. Thus he, like the New England governors, has requested that the Canadian government intervene for the interim to keep the peace."
amcivwar.151.a:0 "Alaska is on its own"
amcivwar.151.b:0 "We should move in"

amcivwar.152.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDefCap] Seizes Alaska"
amcivwar.152.d:0 "The territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor feared a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to - and thus made a formal request to [CAN.GetNameDef] that they intervene. Canadian troops and supply trucks have already moved into the region."
amcivwar.152.a:0 "We will deal with this later"

amcivwar.156.t:0 "The Fate of America"
amcivwar.156.d:0 "With the civil war over, we find ourselves left to figure out what we're to do with the American territory now under our control."

amcivwar.157.d.supported:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap], true to their pledge of supporting us through the civil war, has returned much of their occupied American territory to us."
amcivwar.157.d.notsupported:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] occupied a fair emount of American territory during the civil war. Now their government has approached us, returning much of it to its 'rightful owner', no questions asked."
amcivwar.157.a:0 "We appreciate it"

amcivwar.158.t:0 "American Land Returned"
amcivwar.158.d:0 "Our Canadian allies, true to their word, have turned over almost all their occupied American territory to us."
amcivwar.158.a:0 "We appreciate it"

amcivwar.159.t:0 "A New American Government"
amcivwar.159.d:0 "With the former governments in tatters, we will need to establish something from the old. What form shall the new government take?"
amcivwar.159.a:0 "The United States of America, as is proper"
amcivwar.159.b:0 "The Pacific States of America"
amcivwar.159.c:0 "The American Union State"
amcivwar.159.e:0 "New England"

amcivwar.160.t:0 "The Fate of New England"
amcivwar.160.d:0 "We are currently occupying New England. Should we return it to [america_country.GetNameDef] or continue our occupation?"
amcivwar.160.a:0 "Return it to them"
amcivwar.160.b:0 "We deserve it, after all we did"

amcivwar.161.t:0 "The Fate of Alaska"
amcivwar.161.d:0 "We are currently occupying Alaska. Should we return it to [america_country.GetNameDef] or continue our occupation?"

amcivwar.162.t:0 "Elections for [america_country.GetNameDef]?"
amcivwar.162.d:0 "It's been over a year since the new government was established in [america_country.GetNameDef], and our allies there say they are ready to stand on their own feet again. Shall we allow them to hold elections and continue on as free allies?"
amcivwar.162.a:0 "Of course"
amcivwar.162.b:0 "They're not ready"

amcivwar.163.t:0 "Peace with Canada?"
amcivwar.163.d:0 "We have occupied Ottawa, and currently have the Canadians on the run. Perhaps the time has come to make peace, lest we find ourselves dragged down in their expansive territory."
amcivwar.163.a:0 "Very well, let's end this"
amcivwar.163.b:0 "Only if they give us land concessions"
amcivwar.163.c:0 "We intend to teach them a lesson"

amcivwar.164.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
amcivwar.164.d:0 "We have received an envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government, saying they have occupied enough of Canada and hope we have learned an abject lesson. They're willing to consider peace, though warn us severely that next time they will not be so lenient."
amcivwar.164.a:0 "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.164.b:0 "No, we can still win!"

amcivwar.165.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
amcivwar.165.d:0 "The Canadian government, having been beaten soundly by [From.From.GetNameDef], wishes to pull out completely from its involvement in the civil war, and thus has asked for peace with [Root.GetNameDef]."
amcivwar.165.a:0 "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.165.b:0 "We intend to teach them a lesson"

amcivwar.166.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Proposal"
amcivwar.166.d:0 "We are currently in a ceasefire with [CSA.GetNameDef], but none of us are under the illusion that this is anything more than a respite before the fighting resumes. The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a proposal: if we join the Entente, they'll fight on our side when the battle resumes. It makes sense, considering that the Canadians fear [CSA.GetNameDef] as much as we do, but some in our government oppose the idea of leashing ourselves to the Entente cause. We will, after all, be locked into their wars in Europe even should we win the civil war now."
amcivwar.166.a:0 "We need their help to win the war"
amcivwar.166.b:0 "No, we will do this without their help"

amcivwar.167.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
amcivwar.167.d:0 "Grateful for our assistance, the [From.GetAdjective] government has chosen to accept our offer and has formally joined the Entente."
amcivwar.167.a:0 "Three Cheers for America!"

amcivwar.168.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects our Offer"
amcivwar.168.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our alliance offer, perhaps believing that they can win the civil war on their own."
amcivwar.168.a:0 "How disappointing!"

amcivwar.169.t:0 "[CAL.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
amcivwar.169.d:0 "Obviously fearing our ultimate victory, the [CAL.GetAdjective] government has cozied up to the Canadians and the British. We will need to fight them all, once the ceasefire is done."
amcivwar.169.a:0 "So be it!"

amcivwar.199.t:0 "Last America Standing"
amcivwar.199.d:0 "It is beginning to dawn upon our citizens that the American civil war is actually over. The scars from the fighting will last for a long time, but it seems as if the feeling has already started to sink in that any chance to change America's destiny further has passed. We are now and forever more [Root.GetNameDef], and the world should know that is so."
amcivwar.199.a:0 "God bless America!"


### Rocky Mountain Ceasefire ###

amcivwar.200.t:0 "A Possible Ceasefire"
amcivwar.200.d:0 "The civil war has ravaged America, and there is a growing discussion within the government regarding approaching [CAL.GetNameDef] for a possible ceasefire. Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover. Eventually a reckoning would be necessary, of course, but if we don't attempt this now the war may drag on even longer as a result."
amcivwar.200.a:0 "Let's meet them in Denver"
amcivwar.200.b:0 "No, there's no point in this"

amcivwar.201.t:0 "Ceasefire Talks in Denver"
amcivwar.201.d:0 "With the war between [survivor.GetNameDef] and [CAL.GetNameDef] dragging on, talks have been held between highly-placed officials on both sides regarding a possible ceasefire. This comes at the urging of the [survivor.GetAdjective] government, though it's unknown just how much traction there currently is. We shall see within a couple of days whether anything comes of it."
amcivwar.201.a:0 "An interesting idea?"

amcivwar.202.t:0 "The Proposal"
amcivwar.202.d:0 "After two days of talks, army officials have put together a proposal: any states west of the Mississippi River which are currently occupied by [CAL.GetAdjective] forces would be ceded to [CAL.GetNameDef], with some gaps filled in on the map - though nothing they can't properly supply. The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."
amcivwar.202.a:0 "This will do."
amcivwar.202.b:0 "They're asking for too much!"
ACW_agree_proposal:0 "Agree to the proposal as it stands"
ACW_we_will_try_again:0 "We will go back to the table and try again..."

amcivwar.203.t:0 "There Will be no Ceasefire"
amcivwar.203.d:0 "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. Talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a ceasefire have vanished. The war resumes."
amcivwar.203.a:0 "So much for that"

amcivwar.204.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.204.d:0 "Talks with [CAL.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the eastern side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
amcivwar.204.a:0 "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.205.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.205.d:0 "Talks with [From.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the western side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
amcivwar.205.a:0 "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.206.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.206.d:0 "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [CAL.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."
amcivwar.206.a:0 "We'll see how long it lasts"

### Liberia and Philippines in Chaos ###

amcivwar.212.t:0 "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.212.d:0 "Liberia has been under the economic and effective political dominance of the USA since its foundation as a colony for freed slaves in 1822. This dominance has also helped to protect her from European colonial powers. However, now the USA is in chaos, as rival political factions make a bid for the Presidency. The conflict has now deepened to the point of war. No longer can they be relied upon for protection. Now we must decide how we are to survive."
amcivwar.212.a:0 "Lapdogs no longer - we can protect ourselves!"

Should we appease them and show that the America Huey originally envisioned still exists?"
