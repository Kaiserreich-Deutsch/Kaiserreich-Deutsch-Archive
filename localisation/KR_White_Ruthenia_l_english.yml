### Leaders ###
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "King Uladzimir von Hohenzollern, born Waldemar, nephew of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, though German by birth, has largely assimilated into Ruthenian culture. Though his adopted nation is poor, and by German standards quite backwards, it is rapidly modernising. With an increasingly uncertain political climate both in White Ruthenia and abroad, Uladzimir seeks to lead his country and people into a brighter future while mitigating the influence of political radicals."
POLITICS_SIGISMUND_DESC:0 "King Žyhimont von Hohenzollern, born Sigismund, former head of the Ruthenian national security service and brother of ex-king Uladzimir, has assumed control of White Ruthenia. He is closely linked to Belarusian ultra-nationalists, and supports the forced assimilation and persecution of minority groups within White Ruthenia."

### Events ###
whiteruthenia.1.t:0 "Sigismund makes his move..."
whiteruthenia.1.d:0 "The White Ruthenian National Theatre in Minsk is hosting an exceptional performance tonight, as the famous Der Freischütz is on the programme. His Majesty Vladimir I, King of White Ruthenia and his entire family are in attendance. His Highness the Prince Sigismund has only reached the building after the third whistle and as he is approaching the entrance..."
whiteruthenia.1.a:0 "An explosion rips apart the National Theatre!"
whiteruthenia.1.b:0 "He is arrested by gendarmes as his vile plot is foiled!"
whiteruthenia.1.c:0 "Sigismund takes his seat and all is well."
whiteruthenia.2.t:0 "Rethinking Our Place In the Reichspakt."
whiteruthenia.2.d:0 "Sigismund has called a secret cabinet to debate our continued stance on the Reichspakt. While supporting Germany in their war against Syndicalism has gained us little, leaving the alliance would remove our protection from other threats such as a resurgent Russia. Several ministers have proposed that we leave the Reichspakt and try to court the Russians with an alliance directly while a few others are demanding we become isolationist. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.2.a:0 "We should ally with the Lithuanians."
whiteruthenia.2.b:0 "Try to ally with Russia."
whiteruthenia.2.c:0 "Stay loyal to the Germans."
whiteruthenia.2.e:0 "We need no outside help!"
whiteruthenia.3.t:0 "White Ruthenian Alliance?"
whiteruthenia.3.d:0 "A secretive envoy from the White Ruthenian government has come to us offering not only to leave Germany's Reichspakt bloc, but also a military alliance with us. While it would certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, Germany's reaction to the loss of one of their key eastern allies could lead to a counter-response and even possibly war. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.3.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
whiteruthenia.3.b:0 "Leave the White Rus to their own fate."
whiteruthenia.3.c:0 "We shall reintegrate them by force."
whiteruthenia.4.t:0 "White Ruthenia Abandons the Reichspakt for Russia"
whiteruthenia.4.d:0 "The treacherous White Ruthenians under their new king Sigismund has left the Reichspakt. Their ambassador in Berlin formally tendered a letter to the Reichstag claiming that White Ruthenia is a sovereign nation able to make its own decisions. Even more shocking, White Ruthenia has gone ahead and entered a formal alliance with the Russians. This outrageous betrayal has torn asunder our entire defensive plan for the East in the face of the expansionist Russian threat. While some officials are calling for calm senior members of the general staff are itching to go to war, convinced that we can defeat the White Ruthenia before any fighting in the west begins."
whiteruthenia.4.a:0 "They were useless anyway."
whiteruthenia.4.b:0 "We shall crush these upstarts!"
whiteruthenia.5.t:0 "White Ruthenia Abandons the Reichspakt"
whiteruthenia.5.d:0 "The treacherous White Ruthenians under their new king Sigismund has left the Reichspakt. Their ambassador in Berlin formally tendered a letter to the Reichstag claiming that White Ruthenia is a sovereign nation able to make its own decisions. Even more shocking, White Ruthenia has gone ahead and entered a formal alliance with the Russians, abandoning our military effort in its time of need. This outrageous betrayal has torn asunder our entire defensive plan for the East in the face of the expansionist Russian threat. While some officials are calling for calm senior members of the general staff are itching to go to war, convinced that the loss of our eastern ally is worth diverting troops away from the Syndicalist war to address."
whiteruthenia.5.a:0 "Leave the fools to it then."
whiteruthenia.5.b:0 "Begin preparations for punitive action!"
whiteruthenia.6.t:0 "Fall Jungingen"
whiteruthenia.6.d:0 "With a week having passed since we began preparations for the reconquest of the backstabbing White Ruthenians, we are ready as we will ever be and forces at the border are requesting permission to proceed."
whiteruthenia.6.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
whiteruthenia.6.b:0 "This was a mistake."

whiteruthenia.29.t:0 "Alliance Offer From White Ruthenia"
whiteruthenia.29.d:0 "Sigismund, the King of White Ruthenia has sent us a message expressing his desire to ally with us. Sigismund is not only a German but also a Hohenzollern, which means that our dedication to our anti-Germanism policy would be questioned. However, we are alone and any allies are better than none. It is likely that the Germans will not let us remain free as it may undermine the unity of the Reichspakt alliance, so perhaps we should consider this offer seriously."
whiteruthenia.29.a:0 "An alliance is in both of our interests."
whiteruthenia.29.b:0 "No. They cannot help us."
whiteruthenia.36.t:0 "Nationalist Revolt in the East"
whiteruthenia.36.d:0 "Horrible news! Within two days Nationalists in both Lithuania and White Ruthenia have seized their respective governments and abandoned the Reichspakt! To make matters worse they have also formally allied with one other, clearly intended to act in opposition against us. With the possibility of a brutal conflict to reestablish control over the East, it is not likely the German people will be supportive of military action. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.36.a:0 "We must stem the tide of rebellion."
whiteruthenia.36.b:0 "Intervening would be too costly..."
whiteruthenia.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the value of the Berlin Stock Exchange suddenly collapsed, wiping out the value of hundreds of companies and devastating markets across German-dominated Europe. Now the effects of the shock have finally begun to wash over White Ruthenia. Dozens of prominent companies have fallen into insolvency or shed most of their work-force, the White Ruthenian Rubieĺ is losing value, and our exports are falling off a cliff. Any foreigners with cash left standing wouldn't touch our economy with a barge pole."
whiteruthenia.30.a:0 "Damn those investors!"
whiteruthenia.31.t:0 "Ostwall Overhaul"
whiteruthenia.31.d:0 "With the Russian armed forces emerging from years of neglect and becoming a fearsome force once again, it is high time for us to improve our somewhat diminished border defences. Our top military leaders have petitioned the central government to devote extra funding to the improving existing fortifications along the border with Russia, known as the Ostwall. Once fully resored, such massive fortifications will surely help to stop any kind of Russian assault."
whiteruthenia.31.a:0 "Fund it!"

whiteruthenia.32.t:0 "Ostwall Supply Depots"
whiteruthenia.32.d:0 "A series of new reinforced supply depots have been constructed, solving one of the most pressing vulnerabilities in the design of the White Ruthenian section of the Ostwall. With ammunition dumps far better protected from enemy artillery and commando raids, our defences have been strengthened immeasurably. Should we stop here, or continue rebuilding the defences?"
whiteruthenia.32.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.33.t:0 "Ostwall Anti-Tank Defences"
whiteruthenia.33.d:0 "Construction finished today on a new network of major anti-tank defences capable of posing a major threat to Russian armoured cavalry. The Ostwall has traditionally relied upon the outdated assumption that enemy tanks would support infantry and attack in small numbers, however modern military thinking makes clear that relying on this assumption would be foolish. An elaborate labyrinth of dragons' teeth and mines will go a long way to protecting our border. Some generals believe that we have expanded the Ostwall enough, but we could go further."
whiteruthenia.33.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.34.t:0 "Ostwall Casement Bunkers Restored"
whiteruthenia.34.d:0 "Today our diligent engineers finished upgrading the various machine gun nests and bunkers along the line. New lines of fire have been created making the Ostwall far more lethal to approaching infantry and the bunkers themselves have been cased in new reinforced concrete. Shall we continue the restoration or are such fortifications sufficient?"
whiteruthenia.34.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.35.t:0 "Ostwall Renovations Completed"
whiteruthenia.35.d:0 "Today restoration works on the border defences with Russia were completed, ending a long and expensive programme. A bottle of prize Ruthenian vodka was smashed against the side of the final bunker by one of our generals to much amusement. With such protection in place, our independence is secured."
whiteruthenia.35.a:0 "Excellent!"

whiteruthenia.37.t:0 "Unban the Syndicalists?"
whiteruthenia.37.d:0 "With our state beginning to reform itself and embrace democracy, the question has been posed as to whether we should unban the Socialist Revolutionaries. The SRs, was one of the founding parties of the White Ruthenian nation, and its exclusion from politics has been controversial - especially as it was essentially hoisted upon us by the German government. Supporters argue that it would show good faith and a rebirth of the Belarusian nation, and many others have relented, saying that the Syndicalists have little chance of achieving power anyway."
whiteruthenia.37.a:0 "What harm could it do?"
whiteruthenia.37.b:0 "We will not take any chances."
whiteruthenia.38.t:0 "Sigismund Launches A Coup!"
whiteruthenia.38.d:0 "Now that the power of his security services have been curtailed, Sigismund, seeing his chances of ever claiming the White Ruthenian throne diminishing, has decided to gamble it all in a coup d'etat. This one last desperate attempt to take power has already lead to running gun battles on the streets of Minsk, and much of the population is in hiding."
whiteruthenia.38.a:0 "The palace is taken and the coup succeeds!"
whiteruthenia.38.b:0 "Sigismund is killed by loyalist police and the coup fails!"
whiteruthenia.39.t:0 "The First White Ruthenian Elections"
whiteruthenia.39.d:0 "With our democratic reformation complete and a nationalist coup d'etat prevented, it is time for White Ruthenia to have its first ever democratic elections. Our nation has come a long way since independence, but this is truly a turning point in our fortunes!"
whiteruthenia.39.a:0 "The conservative the Reichspakt-friendly BNP wins!"
whiteruthenia.39.b:0 "The social democratic BSDP wins!"
whiteruthenia.39.c:0 "The Syndicalist BSRP wins!"
whiteruthenia.40.t:0 "Dealing with Sigismund"
whiteruthenia.40.d:0 "Sigismund has proven an effective head of the White Ruthenian secret police, the NBP, and he has protected the state diligently. Unfortunately, his vocal claims to be the rightful heir to the throne and his festering resentment of his brother Uladzimir has been a constant thorn in the government's side. Given his substantial support among the police, security forces and the Ruthenian military, it is likely that he could even pose an existential threat to the current monarch and government. We may need to, at the very least, consider a renegotation of his position."
whiteruthenia.40.a:0 "Negotiate with Sigismund."
whiteruthenia.40.b:0 "He is no threat."
whiteruthenia.40.c:0 "We must purge Sigismund and his supporters!"
whiteruthenia.41.t:0 "Sigismund Demands A Government Role"
whiteruthenia.41.d:0 "Meeting secretly with a coterie of senior aides and police of all stripes, Sigismund has proposed a deal that the King might find agreeable. He proposes to drop his claim to the White Ruthenian throne under the condition that he is immediately made the head of government as well as retaining de-facto control over the NBP, his secret police power base."
whiteruthenia.41.a:0 "A good deal."
whiteruthenia.41.b:0 "This is too much!"
whiteruthenia.42.t:0 "Sigismund Demands The Throne!"
whiteruthenia.42.d:0 "Sigismund has agreed to enter negotiations but has outrageously demanded that Uladzimir immediately abdicate and surrender the crown to him. While senior officials and palace staff believed that Sigismund would be frank with his ambitions, none supposed he would so blatantly make a grab for power like this."
whiteruthenia.42.a:0 "There is no choice..."
whiteruthenia.42.b:0 "Demand influence in exchange."
whiteruthenia.42.c:0 "Deny his demand, but offer him more influence."
whiteruthenia.42.e:0 "These demands are ridiculous!"
whiteruthenia.43.t:0 "Sigismund Refuses The Counter-offer!"
whiteruthenia.43.d:0 "Though our offer to the presumptive upstart was extremely conciliatory and fairly recognises the enormous power and influence he wields and should be entitled to, Sigismund has unfortunately refused the counter-offer and stuck rigidly to his demands."
whiteruthenia.43.a:0 "Surrender the throne."
whiteruthenia.43.b:0 "Offer the throne but demand influence."
whiteruthenia.43.c:0 "This is completely unacceptable!"
whiteruthenia.44.t:0 "Sigismund Agrees!"
whiteruthenia.44.d:0 "Surprisingly, Sigismund has agreed to drop his claims to the White Ruthenian throne in exchange for the position of head of government. Some officials had been under the impression that he would have tried to hold out for more, but thankfully they were proved wrong."
whiteruthenia.44.a:0 "I'm glad he has seen reason."
whiteruthenia.45.t:0 "Negotiations Fall Through"
whiteruthenia.45.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we have failed to reach an agreement with Sigismund and while he has not yet resigned from government many suspect that he is only staying in his position to consolidate his control over the secret police. Swift action may need to be taken to prevent disaster."
whiteruthenia.45.a:0 "So what, he is no threat..."
whiteruthenia.45.b:0 "Arrange for his arrest!"
whiteruthenia.46.t:0 "Operation Hummingbird"
whiteruthenia.46.d:0 "Operation Hummingbird has begun, a plan for the swift arrests of many of Sigismund's supporters suspected to be involved in plans for a potential coup d'etat. While Sigismund's supporters across various branches of government outnumber Uladzimir's forces the advantage of surprise is on the King's side and cutting the head off the snake may prove decisive..."
whiteruthenia.46.a:0 "Sigismund's supporters defeat Uladzimir's loyalists!"
whiteruthenia.46.b:0 "Uladzimir's loyalists eliminate the Sigismundites!"
whiteruthenia.47.t:0 "Syndicalists Take Power In White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.47.d:0 "The recently deposed King of White Ruthenia Uladzimir foolishly unbanned the syndicalists, allowing them to win a surprise victory in the White Ruthenia elections! Like the fable of the Farmer and the Viper, the despicable Syndicalists have repaid Uladzimir's naive kindness by overthrowing him and exiling him from the country. Many are calling for us to intervene to restore order to White Ruthenia. After all, we cannot tolerate a Red presence in the vital Eastern regions while waging war against their compatriots to the west."
whiteruthenia.47.a:0 "Do not intervene."
whiteruthenia.47.b:0 "White Ruthenia must not fall!"
whiteruthenia.48.t:0 "Belarus Seeks Entry Into The Internationale"
whiteruthenia.48.d:0 "Having overthrown the oppressive German monarchy and consolidated their new state under the banner of Syndicalism, an envoy from Belarus has approached us today asking to join our alliance. A nation hostile to Germany on its vulnerable eastern flank, allied with us, would be a serious boon to our war efforts."
whiteruthenia.48.a:0 "Welcome to club comrades!"
whiteruthenia.48.b:0 "They're too distant to help."
whiteruthenia.49.t:0 "The Commune Accepts Us!"
whiteruthenia.49.d:0 "The French Commune has accepted our request to join the Internationale, and we now stand together against the German imperialists and capitalist exploiters."
whiteruthenia.49.a:0 "Hurrah!"
whiteruthenia.50.t:0 "The Commune Rejects Us!"
whiteruthenia.50.d:0 "The French Commune has refused our request to join the Internationale! This unfortunate outcome means that we essentially stand alone surrounded by enemies on all sides."
whiteruthenia.50.a:0 "It's their loss!"
whiteruthenia.51.t:0 "Belarus Asks To Join The Intermarium"
whiteruthenia.51.d:0 "With the two new Syndicalist states of Eastern Europe joined together in alliance, Belarus has now also asked to join us. Together we will make up a solid power bloc able to defend the interests of the workers in the East."
whiteruthenia.51.a:0 "Of course!"
whiteruthenia.51.b:0 "It's too much trouble."
whiteruthenia.52.t:0 "Poland Accepts Us!"
whiteruthenia.52.d:0 "The Poles have accepted our request to join their alliance! Together we will pose an almost unassailable threat to the interests of imperialists in Central and Eastern Europe."
whiteruthenia.52.a:0 "Hurrah!"
whiteruthenia.53.t:0 "Poland Rejects Us!"
whiteruthenia.53.d:0 "The Poles have refused our request to enter into an alliance with them!"
whiteruthenia.53.a:0 "It's their loss!"

whiteruthenia.57.t:0 "White Ruthenia Demands Our Land!"
whiteruthenia.57.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, having claimed portions of our territory that they claim contain ethnic Belarusians, are now demanding that we either hand these territories over immediately or prepare for war."
whiteruthenia.57.a:0 "Accept their claims."
whiteruthenia.57.b:0 "War? Are they joking?"
whiteruthenia.58.t:0 "Russia Accepts Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.58.d:0 "Against all odds the Russians have accepted our claims and handed over the territories to us! The Ruthenian nation now embraces far more of our rightful historic territory!"
whiteruthenia.58.a:0 "Am I dreaming?"
whiteruthenia.59.t:0 "Russia Refuses Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.59.d:0 "Predictably the Russians have refused our claims and have mocked our threats of war, what shall we do?"
whiteruthenia.59.a:0 "We are in no position to fight Russia."
whiteruthenia.59.b:0 "They underestimate us at their own cost!"
whiteruthenia.63.t:0 "Intervention in the Russian Civil War"
whiteruthenia.63.d:0 "Today while the socialist rebels were distracted fighting Russia, the White Ruthenian government claimed our rightful territory, trying to use weakness of the socialist regime."
whiteruthenia.63.a:0 "We should occupy it as soon as possible."
whiteruthenia.64.t:0 "White Ruthenia Demands Socialist Territory!"
whiteruthenia.64.d:0 "Using our distraction fighting the reactionary Russian government the White Ruthenians are attempting to seize the territory that they claim is rightfully theirs!"
whiteruthenia.64.a:0 "We cannot do anything now..."
whiteruthenia.64.b:0 "This means war!"
whiteruthenia.65.t:0 "White Ruthenia Occupies Socialist Territory!"
whiteruthenia.65.d:0 "Using the civil war as a distraction, the White Ruthenians have seized Socialist-occupied territory they claim is rightfully theirs!"
whiteruthenia.65.a:0 "We will have revenge!"
whiteruthenia.67.t:0 "The State of Affairs of White Ruthenia"
whiteruthenia.67.d:0 "On the 9th of March 1918 Russian troops abandoned Belarus after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the immediate aftermath the All-Belarusian Congress declared the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic catching even Germany by surprise. At first the Germans did not recognise the new state, having intended to use Belarus as a bargaining chip with the Bolsheviks. However after the German Intervention in Russia, an independent White Ruthenian state was recognised by Germany - under the condition that Wilhelm II's brother Heinrich became King, taking the regnal name Hienry I. Under Hienry, the White Ruthenian government began a relatively successful programme of land reform and education programs. Though the former King was effective, illiteracy remained mostly endemic, not helped by the inability of Belarusian nationalists to decide between a Latin or Cyrillic script for their revival of the Belarusian language. After Heinrich's death, his son Waldemar ascended to the throne as Uladzimir I. Plagued with the recurring effects of haemophilia and not trained to any reasonable level in statecraft, Uladzimir has proven ineffective in giving the country the absolutist rule it so desperately needs. As such White Ruthenia remains much as it was after the Weltkrieg. Recognised as little more than a German puppet state with a mostly agrarian and poverty-stricken population, the country cries out for change. The political status quo is currently being disturbed by the machinations of Uladzimir's brother and head of the NBP secret police Sigismund, a figure that sees himself as the rightful heir to the throne. The controversial Prince has made contact with both pro-Russian and Belarusian nationalist groups in his barely concealed plotting to seize the throne from his Germanophile brother. As tensions east, west and at home grow White Ruthenia's situation looks increasingly precarious."
whiteruthenia.67.a:0 "Only time shall tell..."
whiteruthenia.68.t:0 "White Ruthenian Demands Our Territory!"
whiteruthenia.68.d:0 "Following a rise in nationalism and their increasingly independently-minded foreign policy, the White Ruthenian government has threatened war against us unless we hand Brest-Litvosk and Gomel over to them!"
whiteruthenia.68.a:0 "Fine..."
whiteruthenia.68.b:0 "Never!"
whiteruthenia.69.t:0 "Ukraine Agrees!"
whiteruthenia.69.d:0 "The Ukrainians have seen sense and have returned our rightful territories!"
whiteruthenia.69.a:0 "Come home to the Ruthenian nation!"
whiteruthenia.70.t:0 "Ukraine Refuses!"
whiteruthenia.70.d:0 "Unfortunately the Ukrainians have refused our demands and are prepared to defend themselves, even if it means war."
whiteruthenia.70.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."
whiteruthenia.70.b:0 "So be it! To war!"
whiteruthenia.71.t:0 "White Ruthenia Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.71.d:0 "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring Ukraine to cede these lands to White Ruthenia. As White Ruthenia is a part of the Reichspakt we have a duty to at least consider their request. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.71.a:0 "Back them up."
whiteruthenia.71.b:0 "Decline their request."
whiteruthenia.72.t:0 "The Reichspakt Demands Territory!"
whiteruthenia.72.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their German masters, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of Germany makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.72.a:0 "We have no choice."
whiteruthenia.72.b:0 "Never!"
whiteruthenia.73.t:0 "Ukraine Refuses Demands!"
whiteruthenia.73.d:0 "The Ukrainians have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to White Ruthenia. Our envoy was laughed all the way out of their country, and eyes across Europe are watching events with keen interest."
whiteruthenia.73.a:0 "Let us pull back."
whiteruthenia.73.b:0 "We shall take it by force!"
whiteruthenia.74.t:0 "Germany Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.74.d:0 "Unfortunately the Germans have refused our request to pressure Ukraine into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.74.a:0 "Damn!"
whiteruthenia.75.t:0 "White Ruthenia Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.75.d:0 "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring Ukraine to cede these lands to White Ruthenia. As a junior partner in our alliance we should at least consider helping them out. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.75.a:0 "Russia and White Ruthenia should act as one."
whiteruthenia.75.b:0 "Decline their request."
whiteruthenia.76.t:0 "Russia and White Ruthenia Demand Land!"
whiteruthenia.76.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their Russian allies, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of a powerful Russia makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.76.a:0 "We have no choice..."
whiteruthenia.76.b:0 "Never!"
whiteruthenia.77.t:0 "Ukraine Refuses Demands!"
whiteruthenia.77.d:0 "The Ukrainians have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to White Ruthenia."

whiteruthenia.78.t:0 "Russia Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.78.d:0 "Unfortunately the Russians have refused our request to pressure Ukraine into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.78.a:0 "Damn!"
whiteruthenia.79.t:0 "Urbanising White Ruthenia"
whiteruthenia.79.d:0 "The countryside of White Ruthenia has one of the smallest population densities in Europe, with a large number of cities being populated more by the Jewish minority than our own people. If White Ruthenia is to begin to develop a modern economy and industrialise, it is essential that our farmers are encouraged to settle in the cities. Unfortunately, the cost of promoting this migration as well as the cost of building new housing for the migrating residents could be expensive and take a long time to complete."
whiteruthenia.79.a:0 "We can take our time."
whiteruthenia.79.b:0 "Put some emphasis on this."
whiteruthenia.79.c:0 "Urbanisation must be an absolute priority."
whiteruthenia.80.t:0 "Urbanisation Policy Shows Results"
whiteruthenia.80.d:0 "After many months of encouraging urbanisation and settlement into White Ruthenia's major towns, our efforts are finally beginning to bear fruit. Town centres that had been relatively bereft of life since the Tsarist period are now booming with life and civic institutions are gaining strength. Our industry has already begun to benefit from the influx of new workers."
whiteruthenia.80.a:0 "The process is under way."
whiteruthenia.81.t:0 "Urbanisation Policy Succeeds!"
whiteruthenia.81.d:0 "After years of hard work our efforts in encouraging White Ruthenians to move to the cities have finally paid off, and our economy has massively improved as a result. This will no doubt greatly aid in encouraging foreign investment and alleviating the effects of Black Monday."
whiteruthenia.81.a:0 "Finally!"
whiteruthenia.82.t:0 "Encouraging Industrialisation"
whiteruthenia.82.d:0 "For a long time White Ruthenia has lacked industry, receiving little investment from the Tsarist state prior to the Weltkrieg and treated with benign neglect by the Reichspakt system. To make matters worse much of what Russian industry there was began to fall into desrepair as a result of the Weltkrieg and collapse of the Russian Empire, with German companies taking their place. With Black Monday causing immense damage to said German industries, it is clear that White Ruthenia must begin to stand on its own two feet industrially."
whiteruthenia.82.a:0 "We can afford some more funding."
whiteruthenia.82.b:0 "White Ruthenia must embrace the Industrial Revolution!"
whiteruthenia.82.c:0 "Let's not spend too much."
whiteruthenia.83.t:0 "Mechanised Farming Reform"
whiteruthenia.83.d:0 "With the progress of technology, farmings methods have already begun to improve with inventions like tractors allowing us to produce yields far in excess of what was possible previously. Despite these improvements, White Ruthenia remains distinctly backwards and its farming is rather inefficient by modern standards. It is clear that things must be improved if White Ruthenia is to take its place in the world as a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.83.a:0 "There's no need for a huge effort."
whiteruthenia.83.b:0 "Some focus on mechanisation is ideal."
whiteruthenia.83.c:0 "Farming must be completely mechanised!"
whiteruthenia.84.t:0 "Improving Rural Infrastructure"
whiteruthenia.84.d:0 "In many places the roads of the White Ruthenian countryside are extremely outdated and pretty much all of them date back to Tsarist-era Russia. There is minimal paving outside of the capital and most villages are connected only by terrible dirt tracks - an issue that has plagued military planners for years. It is clear that something must be done about this if we are to become a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.84.a:0 "Only limited funding is needed."
whiteruthenia.84.b:0 "Improve some of the worst offenders."
whiteruthenia.84.c:0 "The road network must be completely improved!"
whiteruthenia.85.t:0 "Clearing Pripyat Marshes"
whiteruthenia.85.d:0 "The clearing of portions of the Pripyat marshses is now set to begin. Although the Pripyat marshes are vast and a major attempt to clear them is beyond our abilities even a limited clearance would still benefit our nation in providing new land for agriculture or industry."
whiteruthenia.85.a:0 "Let us begin."
whiteruthenia.86.t:0 "Pripyat Marshes Drained!"
whiteruthenia.86.d:0 "The draining of the marshes has finally come to an end with thousands of square miles of new land having been created for agriculture and industry. Already these areas are coming to be populated by migrants from elsewhere in the country willing to set up farms on the reclaimed marshland. No doubt this will aid our nation in the long run."
whiteruthenia.86.a:0 "Finally!"
whiteruthenia.87.t:0 "The Creation of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.87.d:0 "We have decided to implement our plans for the creation of BelAZ, a manufacturer capable of building various variants of vehicles and machinery at our direction depending on the needs of the state. While heavily funding the programme would be expensive and politically risky, it could undoubtedly pay off in the long run by boosting peripheral sectors and supply chains and it would greatly aid the White Ruthenian economy."
whiteruthenia.87.a:0 "Invest a bit into BelAZ."
whiteruthenia.87.b:0 "Give BelAZ a lot of funding."
whiteruthenia.87.c:0 "BelAZ shall become one of Eastern Europe's greatest manufacturers!"
whiteruthenia.88.t:0 "The Priorities of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.88.d:0 "As a state-owned company, BelAZ is under our complete control - and as such it is up to the government to decide what it should concentrate on constructing. What should we have BelAZ focus on?"
whiteruthenia.88.a:0 "Agriculture."
whiteruthenia.88.b:0 "Military vehicles."
whiteruthenia.88.c:0 "Mining."
whiteruthenia.88.e:0 "Construction."
whiteruthenia.89.t:0 "Promoting Literacy"
whiteruthenia.89.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the late King Heinrich, illiteracy is still a major problem in part due to the bickering between proponents of different alphabets for the Belarusian language. While we agree that eliminating illiteracy should be a priority, the question is how much we are willing to invest to this end."
whiteruthenia.89.a:0 "Slow and steady wins the race."
whiteruthenia.89.b:0 "This issue demands much attention."
whiteruthenia.89.c:0 "This must be a major priority!"
whiteruthenia.90.t:0 "Literacy Improves"
whiteruthenia.90.d:0 "Thanks to our effort the literacy rate of White Ruthenia has finally begun to improve, however we are not finished yet."
whiteruthenia.90.a:0 "The end is in sight."
whiteruthenia.91.t:0 "Further Improvements In Literacy!"
whiteruthenia.91.d:0 "Thanks to our efforts illiteracy is no longer a rampant problem in White Ruthenia, and the vast majority of the population is now able to read and write. This is a staggering success considering the agrarian and rural nature of the nation."
whiteruthenia.91.a:0 "Fantastic!"
whiteruthenia.92.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Research"
whiteruthenia.92.d:0 "To compensate for White Ruthenia's lack of resources needed to benefit our industry, we have decided to begin the mass-production of ethanol fuel. The question is, how much funding should we put into the research for its creation?"
whiteruthenia.92.a:0 "There is no need to waste a huge amount of money."
whiteruthenia.92.b:0 "Give them some funding, it is important."
whiteruthenia.92.c:0 "Fuel is essential for our industry."
whiteruthenia.93.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Breakthrough"
whiteruthenia.93.d:0 "Thanks to our funding, the research for ethanol fuel has had a breakthrough, allowing limited production of fuel to begin. While research will continue, this is a great day for a fuel-independent White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.93.a:0 "Our industry is fuelled at last!"
whiteruthenia.94.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Complete!"
whiteruthenia.94.d:0 "Though it took a while our research into the production of ethanol fuel is complete! Now we can fuel our industry despite our lack of resources."
whiteruthenia.94.a:0 "Great!"
whiteruthenia.95.t:0 "Defending Our Airspace"
whiteruthenia.95.d:0 "Our project to build anti-air guns in order to protect the skies of White Ruthenia from foreign invaders has begun and some are already being installed at this moment. Despite this there are some officials that have proposed that we invest more into this project in order to protect our fragile growing industry from conflict."
whiteruthenia.95.a:0 "Some more anti-air guns would be ideal."
whiteruthenia.95.b:0 "White Ruthenia must be well protected from harm!"
whiteruthenia.95.c:0 "The current amount is sufficient."
whiteruthenia.96.t:0 "Russians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.96.d:0 "While there was some resistance at first from the Russian population in the lands we took from Russia, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.96.a:0 "Great!"
whiteruthenia.97.t:0 "Ukrainians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.97.d:0 "While there was some resistance at first from the Ukrainian population in the lands we took from Ukraine, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.97.a:0 "Great!"
whiteruthenia.98.t:0 "Black Monday Overcome!"
whiteruthenia.98.d:0 "After years of economic malaise due to Black Monday the actions of the government have brought an end to the crisis in White Ruthenia and our economy is reaching a level of success we have never seen before. It is truly a new era for our young nation."
whiteruthenia.98.a:0 "Finally!"
whiteruthenia.99.t:0 "Russia Declares War"
whiteruthenia.99.d:0 "With our separation from Germany and embrace of socialism, Russia has suddenly declared war upon us. Though we have our back against the wall, we must face down the great Russian bear or die trying."
whiteruthenia.99.a:0 "David against Goliath!"

### Events ###
whiteruthenia.100.t:0 "White Ruthenia asks for increased Self-Governance"
whiteruthenia.100.d:0 "A communiqué from the government of the Ruthenian King Waldemar I von Hohenzollern has requested more autonomy in their economic policy. They justify this both by claiming it will easen the burden of their still growing economy on the recovering German one, and that it will make their own, shaky government appear more legitimate."
whiteruthenia.100.a:0 "Dire times afford sacrifices."
whiteruthenia.100.b:0 "In no way, shape or form shall such a thing occur."

whiteruthenia.101.t:0 "Germany grants us limited Autonomy"
whiteruthenia.101.d:0 "The German Government has allowed us self-determination in all things economic."
whiteruthenia.101.a:0 "Towards a better White Ruthenia."

whiteruthenia.102.t:0 "Germany has denied our Request."
whiteruthenia.102.d:0 "The German Government has declined to easen the grip on our economy. In countrary, they seem to be planning to strengthen it."
whiteruthenia.102.a:0 "We will have our independence in time."

### Focuses ###
WHR_crisis_reaction:0 "Black Monday Hits White Ruthenia!"
WHR_crisis_reaction_desc:0 "White Ruthenia has been heavily German-dominated since the declaration of independence from Russia, and has typically lacked the industry to assert itself economically. The effects of this predicament have finally come home to roost after the collapse of the German stock market, and it is clear that White Ruthenia must develop economically if it is to recover."
WHR_urbanisation:0 "Promote Urbanisation"
WHR_urbanisation_desc:0 "One of White Ruthenia's main hindrances to economic development is how spread-out its people are, with many workers in the city of Minsk being of Jewish descent. If White Ruthenia is to develop the people must be encouraged to move to the capital."
WHR_industrialisation:0 "Industrialisation Schemes"
WHR_industrialisation_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to encourage our people to settle in the cities we must start to promote industry, the basis of a modern economy, if White Ruthenia is to at last begin to prosper and take its place among the nations of the world."
WHR_breweries:0 "Fund the Alcohol Industry"
WHR_breweries_desc:0 "Many of White Ruthenia's major alcohol producers, such as the Olivaria Brewery and the Minsk Kristall distillery, have suffered great financial losses from the Weltkrieg and the recent Black Monday crisis. If we were to begin to fund them so as to help them to get back on their feet it would aid our economy and allow us to further market our goods internationally."
WHR_electronics-industry:0 "Develop an Electronics Sector"
WHR_electronics-industry_desc:0 "One area of industry that we have a potential future in is in electronics and communications. If we were to begin developing an electronics industry it would give our nation an uncommon advantage and specialty."
WHR_revive_war_industry:0 "Restore Navahrudak Factories"
WHR_revive_war_industry_desc:0 "Some war industries from the Tsarist era remaining within our lands lie in disrepair, essentially unused since the days of the Weltkrieg. Reviving these industries would allow us to at last be able to build an effective army without relying on foreign support."
WHR_MZKT:0 "Invest in MZKT"
WHR_MZKT_desc:0 "Now that we are endeavouring to create a munitions industry in White Ruthenia we could begin to develop and fund the state-run company MZKT, who could produce equipment, tanks and artillery for the nation."
WHR_flexible_industry:0 "Industrial Flexibility"
WHR_flexible_industry_desc:0 "By ensuring that our factories and workers are trained for flexibility in production, we can allow our factories to quickly convert from producing consumer goods to military supplies or vice versa."
WHR_ethanol:0 "Research Ethanol Fuel"
WHR_ethanol_desc:0 "White Ruthenia at the moment lacks the resources needed to industrialise and relies on foreign trade. We can compensate for this by assigning a team of researchers to invent and develop ethanol fuel to fuel our industry."
WHR_farming_reform:0 "Farming Mechanisation"
WHR_farming_reform_desc:0 "Across the world farming technology has begun to improve making the process of farming quicker and more efficient. Despite this White Ruthenia has remained in the past, further hampering the nation economically. It is time for our farming to step into the future."
WHR_country_railroads:0 "Develop Rural Infrastructure"
WHR_country_railroads_desc:0 "Outside of Minsk much of the infrastructure remains basic and insufficient for the modern day, in many cases dating as far back as the Tsarist period. It is clear that improvements need to be made."
WHR_drain_marshes:0 "Drain the Pripyat Marshes"
WHR_drain_marshes_desc:0 "The dreaded Pripyat Marshes, feared by any invader, form a great natural defence in the west. However there is a lot of potential for land reclamation that could allow us to expand the agricultural and industrial potential of our nation."
WHR_expand_mining:0 "Expand Mineral Exploitation Operations"
WHR_expand_mining_desc:0 "Currently we are forced to import most of our foreign materials due to our lack of resources. However, by exploiting our iron and bauxite reserves, we could began domestically producing steel and aluminium, lessening our reliance on foreign goodwill."
WHR_oil_shale:0 "Prospecting in Pripyat"
WHR_oil_shale_desc:0 "Across White Ruthenia we have discovered many oil shales, particularly in the Pripyat Basin. Access to these resources could finally give us an advantage and allow us to produce oil at home without having to rely on synthetics."
WHR_BelAZ:0 "Set Up BelAZ"
WHR_BelAZ_desc:0 "In keeping with our programme of modernising White Ruthenia technologically and fully making use of what resources we have, it would make sense to fund the creation of a state-owned vehicle and machinery manufacturer to develop equipment that will aid the economic and military demands of our nation."
WHR_literacy_campaign:0 "Literacy Campaigns"
WHR_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "Illiteracy has been a problem for far too long in White Ruthenia, particularly in the rural areas that make up the vast majority of the country and its population. Now that we have abandoned the bickering of the previous years and finally decided upon a script for our language, it is time to banish illiteracy to being a thing of the past."
WHR_living_conditions:0 "Improve Living Conditions"
WHR_living_conditions_desc:0 "Living conditions in much of the nation are substandard and lead to social tensions and disease outbreaks in many of our towns. It is clear that for the sake of our people something must be done about this."
WHR_workers_rights:0 "Reform Employment Rights"
WHR_workers_rights_desc:0 "Currently in White Ruthenia the conditions in our factories and treatment of workers remains poor, especially by international standards. We must take legislative measures to remedy this."
WHR_welfare_state:0 "Establish a Welfare State"
WHR_welfare_state_desc:0 "While much of Europe has followed Bismarck's example and established a welfare state, providing medical care, pensions and affordable housing, White Ruthenia has remained in the Tsarist era as a result of our poor economy restricting its affordability. With our economy improving as a result of our reforms we can begin to change this."
WHR_state_university:0 "The White Ruthenian State University"
WHR_state_university_desc:0 "While we have at last begun to reform education, White Ruthenia still lacks a major university, forcing the more educated members of our population to study in other nations such as Germany to continue their education. By establishing our own university we can ensure that more future students will stay in White Ruthenia and aid our country's scientific research."
WHR_crisis_ends:0 "Rebirth of the Economy"
WHR_crisis_ends_desc:0 "At the time of both independence and the beginning of the Black Monday crisis we were a poor, undeveloped nation, long exploited by Russia. Within just twenty years we have managed to modernise our economy and against all odds have produced a totally new country from the ashes!"
WHR_kingdom:0 "The Political Situation"
WHR_kingdom_desc:0 "White Ruthenia at the current time is a very divided country. Opposing the current reign of the King Uladzimir are Sigismund and his odd alliance of pro-Russian and extreme Belarusian nationalist supporters. This ragtag group hope to overthrow Uladzimir as well as many of the nation's left-leaning founders, many of whom dream of a restoration of democracy or even outright Syndicalist revolution."
WHR_Waldemar:0 "Uladzimir on the Throne"
WHR_Waldemar_desc:0 "While the political system of White Ruthenia is constitutionally somewhat reliant on the firm grip of a strong absolutist monarchy, the current King Uladzimir prefers to leave the day-to-day governing to the current head of government. Vasil Zacharka, a Belarusian nationalist founder, and his party the right-wing BNP are in practical control of the nation."
WHR_Sigismund:0 "Žyhimont's Coup"
WHR_Sigismund_desc:0 "For years since the death of Hienry the weak rule of his unworthy and wrongful successor Uladzimir has driven White Ruthenia into disrepair. But now that the rightful heir to the White Ruthenian throne, the former prince Sigismund, has reclaimed his birthright a new era shall begin for the country!"
WHR_democracy:0 "Reforms In The Kingdom"
WHR_democracy_desc:0 "It is clear that on account of his illness and disinterest in day-to-day rule Uladzimir is perhaps unfit to rule as an absolutist King. However instead of giving into Sigismund's demands, the answer clearly lies in reforming the nation into a constitutional monarchy and restoring at last the democracy of the original Belarusian republic."
WHR_unban_left:0 "The Syndicalist Question"
WHR_unban_left_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to step towards returning to democracy, we must decide if the Syndicalist parties should remain banned or not. While weak and lacking support, they could still constitute a significant threat if allowed to proliferate legally and stand in elections."
WHR_liberalise_press:0 "Liberalise the Press"
WHR_liberalise_press_desc:0 "In the past our press was carefully examined and anything criticising our regime or the German Empire censored. It is time to reform this so that newspapers and people of all opinions and politics may have a say."
WHR_disband_secret:0 "Disband the NBP"
WHR_disband_secret_desc:0 "While Uladzimir's popularity has begun to increase among the people following our reforms, Sigismund and his supporters in the NBP secret police remain a major threat to the new government. It is time to disband the secret police and arrest Sigismund himself if it comes to that."
WHR_elections:0 "Call New Elections"
WHR_elections_desc:0 "Now that all threats to our new democracy have been eliminated, it is time for White Ruthenia to finally hold its first ever elections."
WHR_authoritarian:0 "Maintain Absolutism"
WHR_authoritarian_desc:0 "If White Ruthenia's problems stem from Uladzimir's lack of a firm rule, then it is clear what must be done!"
WHR_special_courts:0 "Establish Special Courts"
WHR_special_courts_desc:0 "In spite of our best efforts syndicalists, pro-Russians and other enemies of the state still run rampant. It is clear that the NBP need to increase their operations, starting with secret trials of those whose opinions we deem unacceptable."
WHR_censor_press:0 "Extend Press Censorship"
WHR_censor_press_desc:0 "Even with our current censorship, our enemies have still been able to secretly spread their ideals in many of the popular newspapers. We must begin to strictly dictate what content newspapers are to publish and ban those who refuse to conform."
WHR_sigismund_negotiations:0 "The Position of Sigismund"
WHR_sigismund_negotiations_desc:0 "Despite Uladzimir's recent show of strength his resentful brother Sigismund still claims himself the rightful king of White Ruthenia, and is amassing a number of supporters throughout all branches of government. This problem must be dealt with one way or another as soon as possible, as every more minute wasted gives Sigismund more time to plot."
WHR_BPSR:0 "The BPSR Takeover"
WHR_BPSR_desc:0 "The BPSR, despite their long ban, has been able to use their legacy in having been one of the founding parties of the original Belarusian People's Republic to score a miracle victory! Who knows what lies next for White Ruthenia."
WHR_revolution:0 "Overthrow the Monarchy"
WHR_revolution_desc:0 "Now that the true representatives of the Belarusian people have gained power, it is time to finally send the tyrannical Hohenzollerns back where they belong!"
WHR_syndicalism:0 "Continue the Syndicalist Revolution"
WHR_syndicalism_desc:0 "Now that we have finally become an independent republic once again, we must continue the Syndicalist revolution alongside the French and the British until all the workers of Europe have joined us in being free from Hohenzollern tyranny."
WHR_bolshevik:0 "Embrace Bolshevism"
WHR_bolshevik_desc:0 "Despite the success of the syndicalist revolutions in the west, Bolshevism remains the true revolutionary ideology of eastern nations. We must embrace our roots, a belief which was cruelly crushed by the combined reactionary forces of Germany and White Russia."
WHR_land_confiscation:0 "Land Confiscations"
WHR_land_confiscation_desc:0 "The peasantry of Belarus have for a long time been under the thumb of the rich kulaks and the landlords. Many of these landlords are not even Belarusians at all but in fact are of Polish descent. The peasantry of Belarus must take back their land from these robbers of the people so that we can begin to establish agricultural collectives."
WHR_central_planning:0 "Central Planning"
WHR_central_planning_desc:0 "While some diehard syndicalists might accuse of being merely state capitalists, an economy dictated not by syndicates or free market but by the needs of the government is the most efficient system, as even the newfound Totalist movement admits."
WHR_recreate_police:0 "Recreate the Secret Police"
WHR_recreate_police_desc:0 "While we revile the despicable NBP they certainly did their job in repressing dissent towards the regime. It would be both greatly beneficial and ironic for us to create a secret police of our own, this time in service of the worker and not of the capitalist exploiters."
WHR_empower_unions:0 "Empower the Trade Unions"
WHR_empower_unions_desc:0 "The rights of the workers and trade unions were often ruthlessly repressed by the former regime. Now that we are in power, it is time to adapt the nation to a new Syndicalist system."
WHR_industrial_cooperatives:0 "Create Industrial Cooperatives"
WHR_industrial_cooperatives_desc:0 "As a result of long neglect from both Russia and our former German masters Belarus contains a significant lack of industry. We must begin to create industrial cooperatives so as to begin turning our country into a modern Syndicalist nation."
WHR_arm_people:0 "Arm the People"
WHR_arm_people_desc:0 "The Germans feared the might of the proletariat and so their puppets forbade the Belarusian peasantry from owning significant weaponry. Now that they are gone everyone must learn from a young age how to fight and the necessity of defending their freedom against capitalist exploitation."
WHR_allies:0 "Finding International Allies"
WHR_allies_desc:0 "While we have maintained our independence so far and consolidated our regime, the capitalist powers will eventually turn their attention towards us. If we wish to maintain our current existence, we must find allies to protect us and join them in the battle to finally free the world from the clutches of capitalism."
WHR_internationale:0 "Join The Internationale"
WHR_internationale_desc:0 "The Internationale is at the forefront of international socialism and the main military alliance for socialist nations. It would be foolish not to seek friendship with the communards in Paris."
WHR_intermarium:0 "Join The Intermarium"
WHR_intermarium_desc:0 "Our slavic brothers in Poland and the Ukraine have cast off their shackles and opted to form a military alliance to prevent the spread of Russo-German aggression. Naturally we should seek to join this budding alliance."
WHR_BSDP:0 "The BSDP Triumphant!"
WHR_BSDP_desc:0 "One of the main founding parties of the Belarusian People's Republic, the BSDP have long hoped for a restoration of democracy. Now the day has finally come and the BSDP have been victorious in the first elections."
WHR_agricultural_cooperatives:0 "Incentivise Cooperatives"
WHR_agricultural_cooperatives_desc:0 "One of the BSDP's programs was the encouraging of collective farms, where White Ruthenian farmers would pool their resources together rather than working individually. Unlike the extremists of the far-left and far-right the idea was to be entirely voluntary rather than forced collectivisation."
WHR_health_care:0 "Create a National Health Care System"
WHR_health_care_desc:0 "Our next programme is the replacement of our current private health care system with a national publicly-funded one. By doing this we would allow all of our citizens to have adequate health care rather than simply those who can afford it."
WHR_social_market:0 "A Social Market Economy"
WHR_social_market_desc:0 "Instead of a purely capitalist system, we must set about on the creation of a third alternative between capitalism and socialism, a social market economy which will combine a free market capitalist economy with social policies that shall establish fair competition within the market."
WHR_BNP:0 "The BNP Remain"
WHR_BNP_desc:0 "The BNP is a right-wing party formed from those who chose to stay loyal to Germany following the dissolving of the Belarusian People's Republic and the ascension of Hienry I to the throne of White Ruthenia. Although lacking power while Hienry was on the throne, their power greatly increased during Uladzimir's reign allowing them to maintain themselves as a major political force."
WHR_government_tradeunions:0 "Government Trade Unions"
WHR_government_tradeunions_desc:0 "Despite many of our nation's founders being socialists, trade unions were viciously repressed following the rise of King Hienry. Now it is time to finally cease their repression and recognise the legitimacy of the trade unions, provided they stay loyal to the government of course."
WHR_encourage_investment:0 "Encourage Foreign Investment"
WHR_encourage_investment_desc:0 "Currently our country lacks industry despite our current attempts. Perhaps by taking certain measures in promoting capitalism and the free market we can encourage foreign companies to base themselves in White Ruthenia, although such measures may be expensive and possibly unpopular among the people."
WHR_economic_boom:0 "Harness The Boom"
WHR_economic_boom_desc:0 "Our free market reforms have worked and our economy is finally beginning to boom. The days of White Ruthenia being an overlooked and undeveloped province of Poland and Russia shall finally come to an end."
WHR_disband_rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
WHR_disband_rada_desc:0 "Despite our takeover the Rada remains full of Uladzimir's supporters in the BNP as well as the democrats of the BSDP. We must enact emergency measures and disband the Rada before either parties have a chance to sabotage our regime."
WHR_paramilitaries:0 "Expand the NBP"
WHR_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Our coup d'etat and and disbanding of the Rada has created a lot of anger and militancy across the countries from our political enemies. If we are to maintain stability the NBP must be expanded and reorganised into paramilitary units."
WHR_BR:0 "Side With Belaya Rus"
WHR_BR_desc:0 "Despite our former alliance with extremist Belarusian nationalists, we cannot trust the crypto-syndicalist rabble to run the country. We must align ourselves with the pro-Russian elites if national order and stability is to be maintained."
WHR_orthodox_support:0 "Court The Church"
WHR_orthodox_support_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church plays a major role in White Ruthenian society and by gaining the official outspoken support of the Church we can promote our new order to the average population and minimise any resistance."
WHR_purge_socialists:0 "Purge the Socialists"
WHR_purge_socialists_desc:0 "Despite years of being on the fringes politically, the syndicalists and social democrats still maintain quite a bit of support among some in the nation. The NBP must vigorously root out and destroy any lefist sentiments among the populace if our regime is to be unopposed."
WHR_labour_battalions:0 "Create Labour-Battalions"
WHR_labour_battalions_desc:0 "Our regime still remains unpopular among many who lack employment. By creating labour battalions and public works programs we can keep the people employed and help to build up White Ruthenia into a strong and modern nation."
WHR_BNSP:0 "Alliance with the BNSP"
WHR_BNSP_desc:0 "The BNSP, formed by extremist Belarusian nationalists Fabijan Akinčyc and Uladzislaŭ Kazloŭski, has been one of Žyhimont's main co-conspirators and supporters in the takeover of White Ruthenia. By allying with them we can gain the support of the people for our new regime and build White Ruthenia into a strong nation, never to be exploited again."
WHR_peoples_self-help:0 "Belarusian People's Self-Help"
WHR_peoples_self-help_desc:0 "To promote our alliance with the BNSP we shall create the Belarusian People's Self-Help, a nationalist organisation with control over culture, education, health and social and economic projects, which shall help us build and enforce our new order."
WHR_persecute_minorities:0 "Persecute Minorities"
WHR_persecute_minorities_desc:0 "For a long time the lands of White Ruthenia have been defiled by foreign invaders such as the Jews, who even make up a good amount of our capital's population, and the Islamic Tatars. We must awaken our people to the threat they possess and begin to persecute them so as to finally drive them out of our country."
WHR_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
WHR_collectivisation_desc:0 "White Ruthenian agriculture remains inefficient and backwards with many farms not producing enough to feed the population. The clear solution is this is the complusory unification of individual farms into collective state-run farms that will be able to feed the nation."
WHR_foreign_intelligence:0 "Establish a Foreign Intelligence Branch"
WHR_foreign_intelligence_desc:0 "Now that we have consolidated our regime at home and expanded the NBP, we can begin the creation of a foreign intelligence unit that will allow us to spy on and collect information from other nations, allowing us to stay one step ahead of the rest."
WHR_new_regime:0 "Birth of the New Regime"
WHR_new_regime_desc:0 "All remains of the incompetent reigns of Hienry and Uladzimir have been swept away into the dustbin of history! Now a new era has begun for White Ruthenia under the glorious reign of King Žyhimont of Hohenzollern!"
WHR_national_question:0 "The National Question"
WHR_national_question_desc:0 "Although we have secured our independence, our country's nationalists still remain divided on where we should look towards for a greater Belarusian identity. White Ruthenians have strong connections to the Baltics, once even being known as Litwins due to their Lithuanian ways, as well to the Slavs of Ukraine and Russia."
WHR_latin:0 "Adopt The Latin Alphabet"
WHR_latin_desc:0 "We must look to the Baltics and Poland for our cultural identity and officially adopt a Latin script for the Belarusian language. While much of our current literature and teaching is in Cyrillic it should not take long for us to adapt."
WHR_cyrillic:0 "Adopt The Cyrillic Alphabet"
WHR_cyrillic_desc:0 "We must look to our Slavic heritage, and officially adopt Cyrillic as the script of our language. After all, much of our literature and teaching is already written in this script."
WHR_unity:0 "Embrace Multi-Lingualism"
WHR_unity_desc:0 "Instead of alienating many by choosing one script over another, the best solution would be to officially recognise and teach both alphabets and accept our mixed Baltic and Slavic heritage. While this may strain our nation in the short-term in the long-term it will help unify our people and make White Ruthenia into a stronger whole."
WHR_orthodox:0 "An Orthodox State"
WHR_orthodox_desc:0 "Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion in White Ruthenia and followed by the majority of our people, we must ensure that the Orthodox Church has a special role in the foundations and running of the nation, which will help to secure their loyalty."
WHR_secular:0 "A Secular State"
WHR_secular_desc:0 "Although the majority of our population is Orthodox there are still many of other religions, including Catholics, Jews and Muslims. It would be harmful to our nation and its stability to alienate many of our population. Instead we must ensure that no religion is promoted above others."
WHR_belarusian_youth_union:0 "Belarusian Youth Union"
WHR_belarusian_youth_union_desc:0 "We must create the Belarusian Youth Union, inspired by similar youth organisations across the world, to promote traditional values and patriotism as well as train our children in a variety of skills so that they may be stronger and fitter to serve their country when they come of age."
WHR_jewish_autonomism:0 "Jewish Autonomism"
WHR_jewish_autonomism_desc:0 "Our nation contains a significant amount of Jews. Now that we have embarked on a path of secularism and acceptance of all religions, we could offer the Jews political and cultural autonomy which would allow them to prosper and aid our nation."
WHR_limit_exports:0 "Assert Independence from Germany"
WHR_limit_exports_desc:0 "While conditions have improved for White Ruthenia since the end of Russian rule, in many ways the White Ruthenian economy is still exploited by the Reichspakt system and the King still answers to his Hohenzollern relatives. If we are to fully prosper as a nation we must begin to assert ourselves as an independent nation both politically and economically rather than simply taking directions from Berlin."
WHR_ethnic_assimilation:0 "Ethnic Assimilation"
WHR_ethnic_assimilation_desc:0 "After much debate we have finally decided upon and have begun to create a greater Belarusian identity. Despite the early birth of our national identity, the Belarusian people are ready to fight and die to defend their nation at all costs."
WHR_state_assimilation:0 "State Assimilation"
WHR_state_assimilation_desc:0 "White Ruthenia is a multicultural nation, its people being Balts, Slavs, Jews and Tatars, united in a White Ruthenian identity. Our nation shall not be based on ethnicity, but on civic nationalism."
WHR_ukrainian_claims:0 "Claim Ukrainian Lands"
WHR_ukrainian_claims_desc:0 "Despite our initial claims, our rightful lands of Brest-Litovsk and Gomel were given to Ukraine in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Now with our nationalism growing, it is time to claim those lands as being rightfully ours!"

WHR_russian_claims:0 "Claim Russian Lands"
WHR_russian_claims_desc:0 "An artificial line was drawn through our country at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk leaving many Belarusians still under Russian rule. With our growth in strength and nationalism we can claim those Belarusian lands under Russian occupation as being rightfully ours."

WHR_russianciv_requestger:0 "Request German Permission"
WHR_russianciv_requestger_desc:0 "Russia has once again fallen into civil war. If we can convince Germany to support us this could be the perfect chance to seize our rightful Belarusian lands while the Russians are too distracted to do anything about it."
WHR_national_army:0 "The National Army"
WHR_national_army_desc:0 "The White Ruthenian National Army, formed by Konstantin Ezovitov at the end of the Weltkrieg has gradually fallen victim to reductions in size as a result of economic problems and a reliance on Germany. If White Ruthenia is to stand on its own two feet as a country it must have a strong and independent military ready to defend the nation."
WHR_mobility:0 "The Doctrine of Mobility"

WHR_tank_research:0 "Tank Research"
WHR_tank_research_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to mechanise our armies it is time to study one of the greatest vehicular inventions of the modern era, tanks. By researching and building tanks our armies will finally be both strong and resilient as well as fast."
WHR_firepower:0 "The Doctrine of Firepower"
WHR_firepower_desc:0 "If we are to defend ourselves in war our armies cannot afford to simply rely on a swift victory. If we should get bogged down the firepower of artillery must be able to scatter our enemies and preserve the lives of our men."
WHR_munitions:0 "Ruthenian Munitions"
WHR_munitions_desc:0 "At the current time White Ruthenia lacks a major domestic arms industry, relying on others for guns and ammunition. If our military is to prosper we must begin to research the manufacture of weapons so that our nation will not need to rely on foreign arms."

WHR_instil_patriotism_desc:0 "Due to our troubles in creating a national identity to look to and with which to unify our people there is currently little enthusiasm among the population to serve in the military or to fight for their country. We must begin a mass propaganda campaign to rectify this."
WHR_support_technology:0 "Supporting Our Troops"
WHR_support_technology_desc:0 "While guns and ammunition of course take priority for our troops, we shouldn't overlook the value of supporting equipment such as radios, field hospitals, artillery and other supporting equipment that helps to strengthen our army."
WHR_officer_school:0 "Establish an Officer School"
WHR_officer_school_desc:0 "Currently our nation lacks an officer school, limiting the quality and training of our officers.

WHR_exempt_scientists:0 "Exempt Scientists from Conscription"

WHR_defend_ruthenia_desc:0 "While Europe has enjoyed a decade and a half of peace following the end of the Weltkrieg it is clear world tensions are growing and that it is only a matter of time until Europe is embroiled in war once more.

WHR_home_defence:0 "Form the Ruthenian Home Defence"
WHR_home_defence_desc:0 "If White Ruthenia is to be militarily effective in the face of a war we must focus on the homefront.

WHR_improve_cavalry_desc:0 "One solution to the manpower problems facing White Ruthenia would be to begin training our troops in the latest cavalry tactics, which would also have the effect of giving us a military advantage on the open and rugged White Ruthenian terrain."
WHR_equipment_production:0 "Maximize Equipment Production"
WHR_equipment_production_desc:0 "If White Ruthenia is to have a proper army, the production of weaponry and equipment, and the breeding of horses must increase. This combined with a promotion of cavalry training should hopefully encourage new recruits to join and defend the nation."
WHR_cavalry_speed:0 "Speed Cult"
WHR_cavalry_speed_desc:0 "Our nation lacks manpower and cannot afford to be bogged down in a repeat of the Weltkrieg. If White Ruthenia is to be a victorious nation in any future conflict, the emphasis of its army must be on speed and a quick victory to any wars in which it is embroiled."
WHR_ostwall:0 "Restore the Ostwall"
WHR_ostwall_desc:0 "Despite their crippling defeat in the Weltkrieg, it is clear that Russian power is on the rise again. With many in our country harbouring pro-Russian sentiments there is a strong possibility that should Russia begin to turn it's attention to Europe we will be first on their list of revanchist targets. To forestall this we need to restore our dilapidated border defences quickly."
WHR_air_force:0 "The Ruthenian Air Force"
WHR_air_force_desc:0 "Despite the many air bases already built in our country with the help of the Germans we have very few planes in our air force as a result of their cost being deemed too much for our poor economy. If we are to defend our country from the air this must begin to change."
WHR_fighters:0 "Procure Fighter Designs"
WHR_fighters_desc:0 "Should it come to war the White Ruthenian air force should be focused on defending the skies above White Ruthenia and it's allies from invading planes. The fragile White Ruthenian infrastructure and economy could certainly not take a mass bombing campaign."
WHR_anti-air:0 "Develop Anti-Air Defences"
WHR_anti-air_desc:0 "Due to White Ruthenia's current economic weakness industrially and in terms of infrastructure, allowing enemy bombers to get through could cause serious damage to the nation. The building of anti-air defences must be priority in order to prevent this possibility."

WHR_aviation_fuel:0 "Direct Injection Fuel Systems"
WHR_aviation_fuel_desc:0 "The concept of a direct injection fuel system has been around since its invention by the Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman. By implementing direct injection fuel systems into our planes we could help prevent stalling durig the process of high speed aerial manoeuvres."
