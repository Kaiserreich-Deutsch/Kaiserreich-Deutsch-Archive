afro.3.d1:0 "Today is the first day of Eid-ul-Fitr and all Muslims are celebrating the end of Ramadan."
afro.3.d2:0 "Today is the first day of Ramazan Bayramı or the Festival of Breaking the Fast. After fasting for a month during the Ramadan, all of Islam is celebrating this joyous occassion.\n\nIn most households, the men attend morning prayers at the mosque. Then they come home to find a lavish breakfast prepared. It is also customary to eat either dates or some sweets before attending the prayers. For many households, this is the first breakfast served after sunrise in the last 30 days. The younger people in the household — sons, daughters, grandkids — traditionally kiss the hand of the elders, as the elders present them with a gift. The gifts are usually money or gold coins wrapped in handkerchiefs.\n\nThe three days of celebration are organized in a hierarchical manner. The first day is reserved for family members. It is tradition for the younger ones to visit and pay respect to the elders. Then more distant family and neighbors must be visited. This is a time for hugs and kisses. It is also a time for broken hearts to be mended. If there are people who have had an argument, Eid is considered a time to make peace.\n\nAnother famous part of the festivities includes the sweet taste of Turkish Delight. These treats are offered to guests who visit as well as to neighborhood children who run from door to door expecting candy or cash. In addition, Ramadan’s famous drummers visit neighborhoods in the morning. It is customary for the residents of the street to tip the drummer for his service throughout the month."

Today cannons can be heard throughout Egypt from the cities to the country side as people prepare to celebrate the end of Ramadan."
