### Leaders ###

POLITICS_DOUGLAS_YOUNG_DESC:0 "A Classics professor, Douglas Young was an early supporter of the revolution in Scotland, always taking the side of the nationalists and falling in with Robert Cunninghame Graham in the ensuing debates for independence. Later on he abandoned Labour and followed Graham into the NPS aligning between him and John MacCormick. After Graham and MacCormick were arrested, Young barely dodged a similar fate but remained with the NPS, growing irritated with MacCormick's continued control of the party from prison and its lack of action. Finally in 1931 he split away with likeminded supporters to form the socially-democratic SNP in opposition to the NPS."
POLITICS_JOHN_MACCORMICK_DESC:0 "John MacCormick rose from being a barely notable legal professional and activist to at the forefront of the Scottish independence debate, becoming the main centrist figure and uniting that niche in a sea of leftist agitation. MacCormick's political flexibility would cost him his freedom and be arrested for counter-revolutionary activities, though still lead the NPS from prison causing it to fracture. Now back in power, Scotland's own 'King' weilds immense power through charisma and his matyrdom, eager to embark on a moderate and progressive course."
POLITICS_COMPTON_MACKENZIE_DESC:0 "An englishman by birth, Mackenzie became fascinated by his Scottish heritage and became a leader in the Scottish independence movement. After MacCormick's arrest and the fracturing of the NPS, he followed John Kevan McDowall to his reformed Scottish Party, and took up the reigns after McDowall's disappearance. Mackenzie himself believes in a strictly free market and liberal approach to politics in the image of McDowall, contrary to MacCormick's leftist tendencies."
POLITICS_SCOTLAND_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "A cabal of democratic and reactionary politicians, all united in a vague belief of preserving Scottish independence and breaking from the Union, propped up with foreign support. Some do genuinely believe in eventual democracy, others are cynical enough to use their positions to enrich themselves. For now, the Council presents itself as a provisional government until Scotland's new 'benefactors' see fit to allow it self-rule."
POLITICS_FRANZ_DESC:0 "Franz Maria Luitpold Prinz von Bayern, now known by his anglicised name; Francis I, is the German imposed King of Scotland, following the Jacobite lineage. Francis himself has done much to appease the population; taking on an anglicised name; converting to Protestantism and taking it upon himself to learn and speak English. Despite this he is still resented, propped up only by a commission of pro-German lobbyists and seen by much of the population as a tool of Germanic oppression."
