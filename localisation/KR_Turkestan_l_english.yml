POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALIM_DESC:0 "Emir Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan is the last ruler of a royal title inherited from the empire of Genghis Khan, the Khanate of Bukhara, and the nominal ruler of the Islamic Federation of Turkestan. His rule, from 1911 onwards, initially began with promise - the emir enacted reforms in taxation and administration, and some believed that he may be the reformist whom Bukhara needs to become an independent state again. It turned out that his reforms were only there to strengthen his power, however, and the reformers present within the Khanate were exiled or repressed. As the Russian Civil War began, Bukhara, like its sister Khanate of Khiva, broke ties with the government in Moscow and declared its independence - during the conflict, they successfully defeated the Bolsheviks, evicted the British-supported Transcaspian Autonomy, and united the Central Asian lands under a traditionalist Muslim federation.\n\nAs time went on, the Emir has become increasingly influenced by the thought of Ibrahim Bek, a lower class Uzbek tribesman who rapidly ranked up in the Bukharan army during the Russian Civil War. A talented guerrilla warrior, Ibrahim Bek is also a religious conservative opposed to the Jadid movement and speaks to the Emir with the promise of a unified, rightfully Islamic Central Asia. And it seems the Emir is sympathetic."
