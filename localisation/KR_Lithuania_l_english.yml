### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SKIRPA_DESC:0 "Kazys Škirpa's life is quite colourful to an outsider. He was one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army in 1918, and soon worked his way to Major General, but he was quick to realise that there will be no free and independent Lithuania under the German thumb. Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm. And now, he is in charge, under the Lithuanian equivalent title of the Romanian Conducator or Russian Vozhd - Tautos Vadas."
POLITICS_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "Born as Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III ascended to the throne of Lithuania after his father's death in 1929, and has ruled this Baltic nation since. Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, is widely viewed a foreign puppet by his people. A many of many interests, Kazimieras brushes such criticism aside, partaking in the many nicities his station as King allows him. Indeed, his personal garden was created at an exhorbitant cost by even western European standards, a sum unimaginable to the average Lithuanian."
POLITICS_VOLDEMARAS_DESC:0 "Augustinas Voldemaras began his political career in the Russian Empire. A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

### Events ###
lithuania.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania in 1936"
lithuania.1.d:0 "O Lithuania, land of the brave, where oaks grow strong and the people are hardy. What an ironic twist of fate it is that you were saved and 'freed' by the progeny of the same Teutons that pillaged and ravaged your land. You are once more a Kingdom, 700 years after the death of King Mindaugas I, and yet you are a mere puppet state in the middle of the Reichspakt. While you are not as German-dominated as the United Baltic Duchy in the North, your position is still unbearable."
lithuania.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
lithuania.1.b:0 "Yada, yada, just let me play!"

lithuania.2.t:0 "The Kingdom's State of Politics"
lithuania.2.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Kingdom in 1918, and especially after Syndicalist revolutions in the West, Lithuania has been dominated strictly by conservative politics. The clerical, pro-German and anti-Syndicalist Lithuanian Christian Democrats have worked hard to modernise your economy, but their reign might just come to an end, challenged by the nationalist and anti-German 'Party of Lithuanian Interests' led by Kazys Škirpa, as well as the resurgent Social Democrats under Vladas Požela."
lithuania.2.a:0 "Really?"

lithuania.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Overall Situation"
lithuania.3.d:0 "Lithuania is arguably the weakest member of the Reichspakt, but it is critical to the effort of the Germans. It holds a strategic position between East Prussia and Germany's East Slavic puppets and it's the Kaiserreich's only meaningful way of access to the United Baltic Duchy. As such, the Kaiser will be more than willing to reign Lithuania in if it tries to rebel. Russia has a lot of interest in Lithuania, too, and the Belarusian minorities in the Vilnius region have led to friction between the Kingdom and the White Ruthenians. And what of the incoming clash with the International?..."
lithuania.3.a:0 "I'd rather play as Poland."

lithuania.4.t:0 "Adolfas Šapoka writes 'Lietuvos Istorija'"
lithuania.4.d:0 "A young Lithuanian historian, Adolfas Šapoka, has written and published a 600 page tome on the history of Lithuania from it's creation to present day. Seen as highly patriotic and pro-Lithuanian, it is definitely aligned with the views of the Lithuanian nationalists, and yet has been critically acclaimed and distributed across the country, with over 100 000 copies released by the end of the year."
lithuania.4.a:0 "A fine read. But also quite troubling."

lithuania.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Lithuania!"
lithuania.5.d:0 "The rampaging economic downturn that started with the Berlin Stock Exchange has not left us out of the chaos. Now that hundreds of industries in Germany are closing and others kicking out unneeded workers, the demand for Lithuanian agricultural and industrial produces dropped like a rock. Fields are left deserted, unemployed workers line up for soup kitchens by the hundreds and the gross domestic product has plummeted.\nWhat can the poor Lithuanians do against this travesty?"
lithuania.5.a:0 "Who's going to buy our butter and geese now?"

lithuania.6.t:0 "Response to Black Monday"
lithuania.6.d:0 "An emergency session of the Seimas has gathered today to discuss the matters of the Lithuanian economy, which are getting worse by the minute. More and more factories are closing. Farmers, unable to sell their produces, sell their cows and spill their milk on the sidewalks. The unemployed gather in soup kitchens to survive. The Seimas is split between two major factions, both of which have their own ideas on how to solve the situation and get out of the Depression that has been caused by the Black Monday."
lithuania.6.a:0 "Vytautas Zemkalnis - the state should build up profitable industries and industrialise."
lithuania.6.b:0 "Kipras Bielinis - the system must be reorganised to help the common man."

lithuania.7.t:0 "Our Economy Has Recovered"
lithuania.7.d:0 "After a long time of recovery and fighting the plague that was the economic crash of the Black Monday, the economy of Lithuania has seemingly started to recover. Unemployment is dropping and the value of the Lithuanian mark is finally coming back to pre-1936 levels. In slightly more morbid news, the suicide rate, previously leading in the entirety of Europe, is finally lower..."
lithuania.7.a:0 "Good. I'll go loosen the noose, then."

lithuania.8.t:0 "The Third Front"
lithuania.8.d:0 "While syndicalist wretches are thriving in the French commune and the rest of the Internationale, Lithuania used to be solidly defended by these ideas. That has been proven false by the discovery of an underground newspaper called 'The Third Front' (Trecias frontas). While it presents itself as a collection of modernist avant-garde literature that can't be published in traditional media, it is also heavily far-left and agitates for ushering in a new and better Syndicalist government in the nation. How should we respond?"
lithuania.8.a:0 "They are no threat, syndicalism cannot thrive here."
lithuania.8.b:0 "Disperse their circles!"

lithuania.9.t:0 "Nationalist Rally"
lithuania.9.d:0 "The streets are filled with patriotic members of the Speak Lithuanian movement today, with over a few thousand activists marching across the city and demanding to rid the country of German influence.\nAfter visiting the local cemetery to pay respects to the heroes that fought in the Weltkrieg to create the nation as we know it, then returned to the cities, where minor violence began. A few civilians, most of German origin, were injured, a few store windows were left broken and shattered, but eventually the crowds dispersed.\nA few of the most radical participants were arrested, but they are small fries compared to the men organising this mess..."
lithuania.9.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.10.t:0 "Blue Cockades Organise Rally"
lithuania.10.d:0 "The streets are filled with left-leaning students, workers and sympathisers today, as the Lithuanian syndicalist movement, the Blue Cockades - taking the symbols from the cockades Lithuanian revolutionaries used to wear during the Kosciuzko Uprising in 1794. They call for the eviction of German and capitalist influence in the country and the creation of a Lithuanian syndicalist state.\n\nPolice reports prequent clashes between the blue-clad dissenters and the numerous Lithuanian nationalist gangs, the Iron Wolves. Nobody was killed, but many were sent to hospitals or arrested. However, none of the leaders were found, despite known ties to the Lithuanian Work Federation and the underground Democratic Syndicate of Lithuania."
lithuania.10.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.11.t:0 "Election of 1938"
lithuania.11.d:0 "The early rays of the spring sun have begun to melt down the snow across the country, but the politics of the nation are as unstable as ever. Parades of Nationalist militias and dissenters flood the streets hoping for a victory at the election, and the voter turnout has been the highest since the nation's inception. The Christian-Democrats received blows to their popularity from the events of Black Monday, but nevertheless remain strong, while the Social-Democrats are attempting to rally the working class into voting for them. How will the people decide?"
lithuania.11.a:0 "The Christian Democrats remain in power."
lithuania.11.b:0 "Social-Democrats secure a majority."
lithuania.11.c:0 "A coalition of Nationalist parties led by Voldemaras obtain victory."

lithuania.12.t:0 "Change in Political Situation"
lithuania.12.d:0 "Now that the Constitution of 1920 has been revised and updated, making our country more democratic, the stances of the ruling party have changed, too. We can no longer call ourselves authoritarian, we are not a Prussian Constitutional monarchy any-more. We are a full democracy, just with a figurehead king."
lithuania.12.a:0 "Good."

lithuania.13.t:0 "The End of the Kingdom"
lithuania.13.d:0 "As the declaration of the abolition of the position of King of Lithuania and the arrest of Karl Gero von Urach, former Mindaugas III, finalised, the entirety of Lithuania was now transformed into a much different state. The last bits of democracy have been swept away, the Seimas has been dissolved, and the Party of Lithuanian National Interests now reigns supreme. Augustinas Voldemaras has declared himself to be the Leader - Vadas - and put his Iron Wolf brigades to work.\n\nThe creation of the Lithuanian National Republic can now only be stopped by Germany, whose interests in Lithuania have now been sorely broken..."
lithuania.13.a:0 "Lietuva lietuviams!"

lithuania.14.t:0 "Lithuania Declares Independence!"
lithuania.14.d:0 "The dastardly Lithuanians have betrayed us! After the election of 1938, which was won by the national populist Party of Lithuanian National Interests, more commonly known as 'Speak Lithuanian', the puppet Kingdom was rapidly transformed into a radical nationalist republic, with Kazys Škirpa as the 'Vadas' - Leader.\n\nThe Lithuanians have already seized numerous Lithuanian companies and arrested important German representatives in their nation, even their former King Karl Gero von Urach, and declare that they will listen to no one. How should we respond?"
lithuania.14.a:0 "We will crush them in the blink of an eye!"
lithuania.14.b:0 "We have more important matters, leave them be. For now."

lithuania.15.t:0 "A Deputy For The Vadas?"
lithuania.15.d:0 "Now that we are fully in control of the Lithuanian nation, we have to shape the government of the new National Republic into the most preferable for our patriotic goals. The Vadas, Kazys Škirpa, already has a bunch of possible candidates from the party, and he needs a second in command, the person who will keep ties between him and the cabinet of ministers. Which option should we pick?"
lithuania.15.a:0 "Pranas Dielininkaitis."
lithuania.15.b:0 "Domas Cesevicius."
lithuania.15.c:0 "Keep Brunius."

lithuania.16.t:0 "Peace with Lithuania?"
lithuania.16.d:0 "It has become apparent that the Lithuanians will not be an easy nut to crack. Even though the countries of the Reichspakt surround them from all sides, their forces have been able to push back our advances and even captured Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia. Perhaps we should let the Lithuanians go and keep our focus on other fronts instead."
lithuania.16.a:0 "Offer them Memel in exchange for peace."
lithuania.16.b:0 "It's just a temporary setback!"

lithuania.17.t:0 "Germany Offers Peace"
lithuania.17.d:0 "Our armed forces are victorious! The Germans, seeing that they will not be able to defeat us that easily, now offer peace! They even give us the chance to keep Klaipėda, the heart of Lithuania Minor, in the National Republic. Should we accept this peace proposal or keep pushing forward?"
lithuania.17.a:0 "It's a deal."
lithuania.17.b:0 "No, let's press for more!"

lithuania.18.t:0 "The Lithuanians Accepted!"
lithuania.18.d:0 "The Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal. A peace treaty has been signed between the two nations in captured Memel, and Memelland has now been returned to the Lithuanian side. the Reichspakt walks away in shame, and now Germany no longer has a land route to it's eastern puppets..."
lithuania.18.a:0 "As soon as the armistice ends, we'll take it back."

lithuania.19.t:0 "The Lithuanians Declined!"
lithuania.19.d:0 "Peace negotiations have broken down! The Lithuanians perhaps got too confident, and now believe that they can push even beyond Konigsberg! While they are of course foolish to believe that they can take down the Kaiserreich itself, the fact that we now have one more long-term front to deal with is not good for our situation..."
lithuania.19.a:0 "Time for a third Tanenberg, then."

lithuania.29.t:0 "A Dark Omen"
lithuania.29.d:0 "Vyacheslav Vladimirovich was a simple man. Even though his family comes from Russian colonists who arrived here in the late 19th century, he considers himself to be a Lithuanian, even if he speaks Russian and pledges loyalty to Russia. But times have changed. Our new government is openly against Slavs, be it Russians, Poles and Belarusians, and the Iron Wolf brigades have already attacked his peaceful home on the outskirts of Vilnius. Despite loving his homeland, Vyacheslav was forced to emigrate, leave the nation and settle in Dvinsk. Yet another fleeing soul.\n\nWhile some people like Vyacheslav protested the new government with their feet, others are taking a far more active stance. Russian, Polish and White Ruthenian minorities are openly protesting the Vadas's government, urging for action against discrimination. They might be organising into a movement, despite our fierce opposition to that..."
lithuania.29.a:0 "Lithuania is for Lithuanians!"

lithuania.30.t:0 "The Alliance for Liberation"
lithuania.30.d:0 "Representatives from Russian, Polish and White Ruthenian minorities, as well as many Lithuanian opposition politicians, have organised an underground assembly of the so-called 'Alliance for Liberation', a movement directed against our rule, calling for a fair treatment of the Slavic minorities. The STT has enough proof, however, that this is merely a lie, and the organisation is planning an armed pro-Russian rebellion against the state. The Alliance is unorganised and lacks a leader, but that might change soon."
lithuania.30.a:0 "We'll keep an eye on this treachery."

lithuania.31.t:0 "The Silver Knight"
lithuania.31.d:0 "Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, a Polish-Lithuanian noble from Kretinga, has risen to become the new leader of the pro-Slavic Alliance for Liberation. A descendant of the original House of Gediminas that ruled the Grand Duchy in medieval times, Tiškevičius is opposed to the Republic that we have founded and wishes to see a restoration of a monarchy - with him as the monarch, of course. The noble has turned the organisation into a vehicle for his underground campaign, and he has even gone so far as to begin requesting help from the Russians. He is aware that he cannot win on his own..."
lithuania.31.a:0 "He's just a lost romantic. It'll blow away."
lithuania.31.b:0 "This has gone too far! Arrest the traitor immediately!"

lithuania.32.t:0 "The Silver Knight"
lithuania.32.d:0 "An interesting person has arrived to the Duma today. Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, a Polish-Lithuanian noble from Kretinga and the leader of the pro-Russian 'Alliance for Liberation' in Lithuania, he has arrived to request our help in his campaign. Tiškevičius believes that the only path for his party is to execute a coup and cut off the hydra that is the Lithuanian national-populists, and he even swears that he will align the restored monarchy to our interests should he be successful. But many do not believe his story. How should we respond?"
lithuania.32.a:0 "Boy, we'll give you all we need, do the dirty work for us!"
lithuania.32.b:0 "We're fine with Voldemaras in Lithuania, thanks."

lithuania.33.t:0 "Russophile Coup!"
lithuania.33.d:0 "Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius has raised the Alliance for Liberation for a march to Vilnius! His masses are bolstered by what seems to be supporting Russian soldiers - the bastard went to Russia and acquired their support in this endeavour! Traitor! Or maybe our next leader...\n\nThe Alliance for Liberation seeks to restore the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of old, and they are opposed by regular military units in the capital as well as Iron Wolf brigades. This is a battle for the history books..."
lithuania.33.a:0 "Long live the new Grand Duke!"
lithuania.33.b:0 "Iron Wolf militias successfully defend the capital!"

lithuania.34.t:0 "Lithuanian Coup Succeeds!"
lithuania.34.d:0 "The Alliance for Liberation was successful! Kazimieras II Tiškevičius now reigns as the new monarch of Lithuania. And as expected, he is ready to pay lip service to us. A new puppet state has joined the Russian sphere of influence."
lithuania.34.a:0 "Ura!"

lithuania.35.t:0 "Ignas Šeinius - The Red Flood"
lithuania.35.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity.\n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that result in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia experiences a coup led by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled in war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the still-extant British Empire...\n\nThe book has been criticised for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."
lithuania.35.a:0 "Is he trying to make that Universe as bad as possible?"

lithuania.36.t:0 "EuroBasket 1937"
lithuania.36.d:0 "The European basketball championships of 1937, held in Berlin, Germany, have concluded. In a surprising turn of events, the returning champions, the German team, have been bested in a close match by the Lithuanian team, coached by the Lithuanian-American player Feliksas Kriauciunas. German basketball fans have reacted with shock and surprise while the Lithuanians have taken to the streets to celebrate their victory in this David vs Goliath match."
lithuania.36.a:0 "We are the winners - of EuroBasket!"

lithuania.37.t:0 "Death of Dovas Zaunius"
lithuania.37.d:0 "Dovas Zaunius, a longtime diplomat in the Foreign Ministry of Lithuania has passed away at 50 years of age today. An immigrant from Lithuania Minor, he has always represented hope of the Lithuanian people to one day 'reunite the two banks of the Nemunas'. Unfortunately, by 1936, the existence of the Prussian Lithuanians, or Lietuvninkai, has become highly tenuous. Zaunius's funeral was followed by the green-white-red tricolor of Lithuania Minor."
lithuania.37.a:0 "Memento mori."

lithuania.38.t:0 "The History of Lithuania"
lithuania.38.d:0 "Edited by the young historian Adolfas Sapoka, 'The History of Lithuania' is a defining work in Lithuanian historiography, condensing the history of the country from its foundation in the 13th century to modern day in one book which is easy to read for the average consumer. The glorification of Lithuanian heroes and grand dukes in the treatise have led to it being picked up by Lithuanian nationalists as their unofficial Bible."
lithuania.38.a:0 "At least they're happier..."

lithuania.39.t:0 "The National Lithuanian Olympiad"
lithuania.39.d:0 "With patriotism rising across our country, the idea has been suggested to organize a national olympiad of various sporting events where Lithuanian sportsmen and sportswomen, both from the Kingdom and from abroad, would be able to test their skills and compete in preparation for representing their country worldwide. This would be the so-called National Olympiad ("Tautine olimpiada"). The National Olympiad would be opened with a prestigious ceremony this July and all of the participants would swear an oath to represent their nation in international sporting events with all of their might, dedicate themselves to the nation and respect its history, culture and traditions. This would be a fantastic event to rouse up support for our government and calm the nation down."
lithuania.39.a:0 "Endorse the initiative"
lithuania.39.b:0 "It's too costly"

lithuania.40.t:0 "The Cult of Vytautas the Great"
lithuania.40.d:0 "Vytautas the Great, one of the most famous Lithuanian monarchs from the 15th century, has always been a symbol of the Lithuanian fight for independence. He was anti-German and anti-Polish, he promoted Christianity yet was tolerant towards other faiths and cultures, he was a staunch abstinent from alcohol, he was a great military tactician - thus, he appeals to pretty much everyone in Lithuanian society. Already, there are annual celebrations during his death date five hundred years ago, October 27th, and the day when he should have been crowned as the King of Lithuania before his death, August 8th. An idea has been raised to promote this into a cult of the long deceased Grand Duke, tying his image with the image of the government and thus using this cult of personality to strengthen the legitimacy of our government."
lithuania.40.a:0 "Endorse this idea!"
lithuania.40.b:0 "Let's not be silly"

lithuania.41.t:0 "Matas Salcius's Last Expedition"
lithuania.41.d:0 "The famous Lithuanian explorer and traveller, Matas Salcius, has met his end in Bolivia, on an attempt to travel from Alaska to Tierra de Fuego on motorcycle. A cultural icon in his home country, responsible for popularizing foreign travel and interest in geography, his death has been met with shock and surprise from the Lithuanian people. Salcius has been buried in an unknown cemetery in Bolivia, but his heart has been brought back to Lithuania where it has been buried in Vilnius."
lithuania.41.a:0 "Now he can explore Heaven on wheels."

lithuania.42.t:0 "Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture"
lithuania.42.d:0 "Lietuviu draugija prancuzu kulturai pazinti (Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture) is an organization of left-leaning Lithuanian poets and writers with the official stated purpose of learning about the culture of France and how it has been affected by the Revolution of 1919. Notable members are Salomeja Neris, Vincas Kreve and Petras Cvirka. It is widely considered to be a front for the influence of the International in Lithuanian writing circles."
lithuania.42.a:0 "Whatever"

lithuania.43.t:0 "Land Reform Debate"
lithuania.43.d:0 "It appears that the subject of land reforms have again been brought forward, with the former owners of the land now either fleeing to their German villas or selling what they can. This has left large swathes of land to be reappropriated to Lithuanians who are more then willing to work the land. The conservatives wish to give this land via scheme where people are required to pay a small fee till the land is paid off. This would reduce the cost, but also take longer for the Land Reforms to be completed, whilst the Liberals seek to a lot people land for free, with their argument being that the goods being pumped back into the economy will ensure the Land Reforms are completed at a faster rate"
lithuania.43.a:0 "Adopt the Conservative Reforms"
lithuania.43.b:0 "Adopt the Liberal Reforms"

lithuania.44.t:0 "Land Reforms Complete"
lithuania.44.d:0 "After much toiling the land and hard work, the Lithuanian Land Reforms have begun to truly to bear their yield.
