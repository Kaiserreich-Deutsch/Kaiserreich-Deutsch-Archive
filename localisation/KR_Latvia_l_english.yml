lat.6.d:0 "We have received a diplomatic message from our comrades in Eastern Europe - Latvia, also known as the Iskolat Republic, wishes to finally put an end to their enforced neutrality and join the Third Internationale as an equal partner.

lat.9.t:0 "The Wind Blows"
lat.9.d:0 "When the Second Weltkrieg began, the loss of the Baltic German birthright ironically became a sigh of relief. The two states, Latvia and Estonia, served as a neutral bulwark which protected Riga from the full force of the Russian invasion. Despite this, however, the Riga defense forces and their commanders were very well aware that this was merely a brief calm before the storm. Patrols in the surroundings of the city became more frequent, supplies are being stored and secured, a system of food rationing implemented for the average citizens.\n\nAnd then, the first signs came. Increasing Latvian military movement in the surroundings of the city, sometimes even in the range of Rigan artillery outposts - although the German troops opted to not fire upon them just yet. Enemy artillery stationed in the surroundings of the city, preparing to bombard hastily assembled barricades and fortifications. Utter silence from Latvian diplomacy, as if they have forgotten that Riga exists entirely.\n\nBoth sides had something to finish from their last engagements in 1936. The Latvians - to evict the Germans from their homeland at last, to reclaim Riga, their one and only capital. The Baltic Germans - to destroy this insurgency for good, and reclaim their birthright.\n\nA chilling wind blows across the streets of Riga, and with it, follows a barrage of yells, all shouting the same thing."
lat.9.a:0 "To the barricades!"

### Focuses ###

### Ideas ###

LAT_dualism:0 "Dual Rule"
LAT_dualism_desc:0 "The Latvian republic was born out of two organizations and two ambitious men joining in a fragile alliance against the German scourge. The Latvian partisans fought for Latvia, but the Latvia they envisioned differ from person to person - some want a national, patriotic state under a recognized leader, others look up to the socialist Iskolat. Now that the Germans have been evicted, these differences collapse in on themselves."

LAT_remember_riga:0 "Latvieši, neaizmirstiet Rīgu!"
LAT_remember_riga_desc:0 "The beating heart of Latvia, its eternal capital, has been stolen away from us - our partisans have failed to secure the city and a “Free City of Riga” now stands on its soil, a constant reminder that our fight with the Baltic Germans is not yet finished. Latvians, never forget Riga!"
